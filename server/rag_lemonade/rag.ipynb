Are you going to show some Mars with no money? You're going to be broke. I would hate to be broke. No, he puts it on Mars. Yeah, you have to get there. Ready player one. That's is that's where he leaves inheritance on Mars. And then the rest of humanity has to go get it. He's been weirdly quiet about Mars. Have you noticed in the past few years? Because he kind of you know, the whole thing with him blowing past Tesla deadlines used to be blow and pass the Mars deadline. And we'd be like, we're going to Mars this year. We're going to Mars this year. He did say something and we've left it. I think today he said Mars in 20 years, maybe 30. He told he said it was like five years. No, I was like four years ago. But finally, realistic on one. I was talking. We have this discord now that we started the show. And I think I put in that chat. I was like, as much as an Elon Hater as I am part of it. It's excited every time he drops the Mars deadline. Oh, dude, I mean, the Mars would be sick to go. You like no matter how much you hate Elon, like you've got to admit that when the starship caught with the two chopsticks and the space is awesome cinema, right? Yeah, so good. I mean, my the win win will be if Elon goes to Mars. Does that kind of like dream and he's better away from me? Elon and H.R. And Mars together. You two chopping it up with pop spill. Yeah. You're not a long and you have 100K in your pocket. Because I won the March Madness. I'm telling you telling your kids I showed up Mars only 100K in my pocket. Turns out you couldn't buy anything with it. And I built this future for us. I I do have a few topics. I want to list for the audience before we get here. I don't hear it. Stop. No, before you tell me these topics, what? This is a nice thing that I'm doing. I need to do a nice thing for you. OK? I need to do a nice thing for you. And that nice thing is that we need to talk about safe spaces. I think actually, you know, I think Perry has to talk about how you need to use an iPad. OK. No, it's the hostility. You're bringing that over from the other podcast. Now, if you guys don't know at home, Aiden is also part of another podcast called The Yard. OK? I'm happy to say their name. And they bully him a lot. And I didn't notice this, but they pointed this out. And you could pull up the tweet from, let's watch this. Let's watch this real quick. I use Google Translate to talk to my Uber driver. I know. OK, freeze frame right there. He says I use Google Translate to my Uber driver and then pause this like a dog that's about to be beaten. Because they make fun of him so much for just talking to Uber drivers in that podcast. They make fun of me for talking to people. Period. So I was just like instinctively. I was like, yep, hit, let it hit. And then you just just insane. Look at his face. He's afraid. You don't have to be afraid here is what I'm trying to tell you. Is this safe space? You can tell me the topic. And now I can tell you the topic. I'm excited to tell you the topic. This week we're talking about how is everyone getting stupider? Yeah, you would talk about that bitch. Oh, God. Don't ask. Don't ask. I'm going to say space. Like this to me. That was the first thing I've been doing. I was really selling it into my space. And also the fallout of Mark Rober's suspiciously timed video. It feels like he listened to our app and then kind of just pumped that out. That stole your content. Yeah, yeah. And some drama that's been going on in the wake of that. And then also in this era of protectionism in the US, I wanted to bring up a little law called the Jones Act, which is really interesting just to help demonstrate some of the costs of enacting even good intentions behind protectionist legislation, talking about something that isn't tariffs for once in the context of protectionism too. And also we want to do some follow ups on comments and people's feedback from the last couple episodes for you to squeeze that into. Yeah, sounds awesome. About the Jones Act is really funny because you guys were talking before the pod started about how like isn't it crazy how things like that are so effective and then some people don't even know what it's about. I was like, I have no idea. I have no idea. So I'll be the voice of the people on this one trying to learn about the Jones Act from you. I haven't heard about this. But I think you wanted to intro, right? Your topic was I want to call you stupid and I want to call you stupid and I want to call Perry stupid and I want to call myself stupid. It was a safe space for like maybe 15 there. All right. So before you do that, why don't you spend 30 minutes pulling up a tweet to call us stupid to do that. Okay. We've got it. I have a better than that. Okay. A financial times article asking have humans past peak brain power? That's sort of the opening topic everyone's talking about is well, I'll ask you a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a question first. I'm going to ask you even first because I have a specific example. Do you think you're smarter or dumber than you were when you made this video in 2012? Master cabin 45. Do you think you're smarter? Be honest. And when you made this video, are you smarter or dumber? I know it's a little mark, but I'm really on the whole. I'm smarter, but it's, it's closer than I'd like to admit. Okay. So that's the, that's sort of the, the theory here is that beginning in 2012, adults and teenagers have reported marked declines in their ability on math and reading scores and their general ability to concentrate difficulty thinking or concentrating difficulty, trouble learning new things around. 2012 is when it is when it like starts to decline and it's been measurably rising or declining in this case ever since. So up and science reading, Matt's numeracy literacy, what is a little surprising to me? Is up until 2012, you're saying that it was, it was still trending upwards and up and up. It was like stagnant and then it dropped like, do you know? I don't have the date. I mean, it looks like 2016 2012 is pretty flat. Yeah. But I would say the 2000 that we peaked, but like it's been rising, flattened out and now it is declining as of 2012. And you know, that's, I think, I don't, do you have any thought like Doug, what's your first thought when you win when I first thought? I think you and I graduated around 2012. We hit C baby. That's what it's like. Fuckin' gut, dude. Truly representative of the cognitive decline. I mean, I have thought, so I like, I talked to a teacher friend of mine about like kids and what's been going on. I think we, as we talk about it, probably need to separate COVID. My friend who's a high school teacher was saying right now, the last, the way he phrased it, the last wave of kids who are really messed up by COVID are finally like starting to leave the school system. They're covered of us. Yeah. But like, but like they are so messed up. And the way he phrased it was like, these are kids who justifiably have no sense of authority when it comes to like schooling or teaching or parents or anything because there's this two year period where they were just at home and could do whatever they wanted. And he said, as a teacher, there was no way to discipline anybody or stop them from just playing Minecraft all day long. And so the, the structures that we are told as a kid, if you have to listen to your parents, go to school and do these things, just completely collapsed. And so he said they're like kind of getting used to it again and like people, you know, the younger kids who were younger during COVID are now sort of like back into like the way or education. Oh, right. Right. Of the rhythm of how we have traditionally done things. So it sounds like that is really messed things up. And then I, for me, there's a broader question of like, is it a good thing that our school system is dramatically changing? Because my sense from this article is less than people are dumber and more that people are not doing well on our traditional way of grading intelligence. Well, I wanted to dig in. What is the, is there more information here about like the context of why this is happening or how this is measured? Like what is the rest of the, nobody has an exact answer on why, but they posit some couple of things. One is that people are reading less than ever. So the client of reading is pretty dramatic again right around 2010, 2012. And I want to say 2010 is the year that is the year that smart phones took over 50% of the population. So what was you say, phones bad? Everyone loses their mind. But that is like the obvious conclusion they're leaning towards. You think phones are good. You get to be the villain. This is. Yes. He's the one who's going to get the phone bad. I'm so bad. He's the one who's good for kids on the comments. No, I want to be bad. He's bad. So phones and generally it says like our ability to, it's not like reading is getting specifically worse or massages worse. It's that our ability to process information like take information, process it and make it's almost like that when your brain turns on that's to work a little bit, we've sort of pushed past that and they point to a lot of things. One of them they say is not even that it's phones, but it's infinite scrolling on media. Yes. So where it kind of like anytime you get into discomfort, you just move on to the next thing. Your brain does not get comfortable sitting in the discomfort of thought. Can I get in there? Yeah, go for it. Yeah. I'll give. What's going on? What's going on? Theory on intelligence. And total theory on this. Because this is something that I've thought a lot about self-reflecting. I feel dumb or in some ways that I used to be when I was younger actually. And the biggest thing that I noticed was as I've gotten older, my ability to speak in the way I want and instantly come to the words and ways I want to describe things and explain things has gotten less sharp over time, particularly in I would say the last like five to six years. I feel like I was actually better at finding the words to explain things and speak to people when I was younger. And I think that tracks really directly in my mind with the amount that I read because I barely have read up until this year. So maybe before this year, I had not read a whole book in maybe five or six years. And my habit of reading like every day obsessively has been gone since basically the beginning or middle of high school. And I think reading in general, or maybe if you if you intently listen to audiobooks, I think there's there is some scientific. Yeah, I heard that too. Or listening to audiobooks actually is very similar to reading. I think the problem is, are you actually paying attention to what you're listening to in the same way that you have to pay attention when reading? Right. I've seen a lot of this do audiobook and it's not. Yeah. Is I a great place to over? You can just play. You can just phase out while something happens to be on, right? But if you are intently listening to audiobooks, I think it might be it might be the same. And I think that is the number one thing I could point to in my own life is when I was reading every day, I think I had a way better vocabulary and quickness in the way that I was able to like access and explain things. But that aside, my other part of this that I think absolutely has to do with this is it is related to phones and phones are like the way this problem is dispersed in my mind. But the constant like activation, you can you have access to all the time by scrolling things like TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, any or just the internet in general or for me, it's YouTube. Like I listen to a ton of YouTube and podcasts and how I have to listen to those things almost all the time. I always am putting something on. And I think when you're pushing your brain like constantly and you're constantly giving it it's constantly in a state of stimulation, I think things that stand out are fewer and far between and things become harder to retain and memorize. Like a lot of the way that you memorize or like hang on to things is strong emotional like responses to those things. So if you if say I did something wrong, like I did I betrayed you in some capacity and and there's two versions of this playing out. The version where you don't realize anything happened and we never talk about it. I think something like that. And I've hidden it from you for years and you don't really know about it. That versions are dream every day. Your life is worse. I mean, I'm watching you watching you suffer and you have no idea it was me. It was me this whole time. But there's some big lesson. Like there might be something that I have to like learn from that or take away from that that I might not take away because there's no big emotional moment that forces me to confront it. But if you if you got mad at me and we got into an argument, like a real argument, which we've never really done before. We will. It would be it would be very distinct and fresh in your mind. Like that's something that heavily influences memory is like the emotional maybe the emotional state. I'm sure there are better ways to describe this. But basically the state of being that you're in when you're consuming the information. But if you're in like a constant baseline state of information being spit at you all the time and there's nothing to differentiate it from every other moment of your day, it's really hard to actually remember and retain it. And I've been talking about this a lot with some other friends because I think my memory is has gotten worse. And I was like, I don't think I have like early onset dementia or something like that. I hope I think it's just a consequence of the way that I am constantly engaging in messages, consuming media. Like it's a consequence of my phone. Is this way though? Is this like is this something that you've experienced or what's your experience with this over the past? Let's say since 2012 to now. Post phones post. I'm too weird of a person. I think to have a baseline that I can compare against. I think this is a relevant enough time to bring up this tweet. I saw. So this is a teacher who talked about the current state of education and based essentially saying what you are saying, Aiden, so we can start it. That's the old CEO. You guys don't know what's going on in education right now. That's fine. Like how could you know unless you were working in it? But I think that I think you need to know. So here is exactly what it's like right now working in public education. First of all, the kids have no ability to be bored whatsoever. They live on their phones and they're just fed a constant stream of dopamine from the minute their eyes wake up in the morning until they go to sleep at night. Because they're in a constant state of dopamine withdrawal school, they behave like addicts. They're super emotional. Like the smallest things sets them off. And when you are standing in front of them, trying to teach their vacant, they have no ability to tune in. If your communication isn't packaged in short little clips or if it doesn't have like bright flashing lights, it's actually the way harder part for me than just the outright behaviors is just being up at the front, talking to a group of kids who have their eyes open. They're looking at me, but they're not there. Yeah. And that's the core of it, right? Which is wild. Pretty damning and sounds horrible. And so wild. And the response, I think it's interesting. So I saw this response from Emmett Sheer, the old CEO of Twitch and he said, I'm not sure if this is true, but weirdly, if it is, which is a just awesome to open air. Wait, wait, one image here's the thing. I used to work with this guy. He would be in meetings where executives are presenting important things they've worked a whole month on and he's on his phone playing hardstone. This is a fact I will stand. So for him to call out. He was breaking out of the psychic printed. Yeah. That's all I was told. Yeah. So in response to this, this teacher explaining how difficult education is right now, he says, I'm not sure if this is true, but weirdly, if it is, it kind of gives me hope. Blur out the judgment and details. And it sounds like a generation staging a jailbreak from psychic prison. So there he is. An argument that I don't necessarily agree with that the way our schools and the way our everything has been structured education wise is very much about turning the average citizen into a cog into a broad cog that can fit into any machine. And I think arguably that is not a good system for majority of people, particularly in our modern society and that maybe it is a world where we want to have more specialized tools of, you know, AI education or tutors or whatever that aren't just like we're going to jam you into this box, check all the boxes over the course of high school. Emmets take is a bit, I don't know, psychic prison feels like a bit much. Yeah, I feel like that's a little extreme. I think the maybe the like less extreme version of the argument that you're saying that makes, I actually think that makes sense. I think the argument of like making school more specialized and allowing kids to like focus on particular areas that are their best suited for or they're most likely to succeed in is an approach that not only like some schools are able to take in the US, but like if you ask, if you look at education systems in other countries, they often let kids do that like in the later high schoolers, especially right? I think that is a very disconnected from the consequences of kids having fun. There's two paths, right? There's one of just saying that schooling needs are overhaul in general, which has been true for a while, which is like a lot of kids left in the cracks, a lot of kids aren't set for this wrote memorization learning. The physical enough for young boys, I've heard like they don't get enough outside time, especially like there's like aspects of schooling that could be. If we were having this argument about education in 2007 before iPhones existed, that argument would be the same. It was the same thing back then. But also there's the dopamine addiction, which is like, it seems different. And I'll say as somebody who, so I didn't know this, I got an ADHD diagnosis like a year ago, and I'm not about to blame like all of the bad things in my life on ADHD to preface. Publicly, you do it privately but not. But when I talk to, but when I talk to my parents, I didn't know that they knew I had ADHD as a kid and they- Did you not see that video? It was obvious. I'm not sure every one. What the fuck happened to the safe space? All right, sorry. And talking to them, like my, like I think about the, when I was a kid and I didn't, I wasn't allowed to like watch TV on weekdays. I wasn't allowed to play video games on weekdays. I could only, I could read basically. And I, that constant, like part of having ADHD, I think is your constant seek for stimulation basically. And it is hard to focus on things. And for me as a kid that, that ended up getting like captured in books and comic books. Like that was, I just read constantly. I would take a book everywhere with me as a child so I could read every moment of every day. Or I would listen to audiobooks on tape and things like that. And it's, I think there is, I think about what would have happened if I had like a phone instead and just free reign on the internet, which I didn't really have until like mid-teenage years. And I think it would have been really, really bad for me. I would have turned out way, way differently because my effort and focus and like success would have been like completely diverted from like how I grew up. Obviously, that's extremely anecdotal. This is like a very personal experience for me. But I do think on the whole access to like this all the time, like when you give, like I think a really good video on the effects of weed came out because a bunch of like weed research has dropped in the last couple years, like post legalization. And a lot of the consequences of weed can now be looked at in like the long run. And there is, turns out there is really, really bad cognitive effects from like constant or like even small use of like weed, particularly for children. Like it not so much for adults. I'm not here to like edgy, like say like stop smoking weed or something. I think this is the villain. Yeah, that's the villain's the idea. I'm saying the idea that having this device with you all the time that is constantly like pushing and stimulating your brain and giving that to someone who's like young and developing especially the idea that it has no consequence at all is ridiculous for one. Like it would be crazy to have an opinion that it has no way people's phones and their weed. No weed aid in. Honestly, if they're under 18, maybe I don't know if I would have learned anything in high school already had a hard enough time paying attention with like 100% and like having a gamecube at home, let alone fucking fortnight on my phone and clips like I would be destroyed. I completely agree. I'm never saying. And they have data on this. So I'm not remembering to study exactly, but they've done studies on schools that have effectively, again, all schools try it but not effectively, but effectively banned phones and it helps. And when they do it helps, scores go up. I just want to point out for the audio listeners. I got a call from Brandon. I got a call in the middle of that sentence and had to put his phone down on his lap. Go ahead. Sorry. Can I play a quick game of fruit and ginger because I'm getting bored? Yeah. I'm getting fucking in the middle of the sentence reached out for his phone and looked down away from us. I even talked about this. I talked about a similar thing recently on We Do A Little Advice Show for the yard like Patreon. And on we were talking about vices and I think a huge thing for me was how compulsively literally addicted I was to Twitter for years. Compulsive motion of opening the app scrolling without thinking. Close it. Literally open it like a second later doing that all the time. And I think that's what kids have access to. In this story from this woman online, right? That's not a study, but this I have heard this story so much from so many people who teach that phones have like destroyed the classroom. And if we were to go back to what I think is a valid argument actually, which is what Doug was bringing up at the beginning, I think that is again, totally true. Like ways to transform and shape education to make people be as successful as possible and escape the psychic prison, if you will. I got I think that's totally valid. It's just to talk about from. Wait, wait, wait. I can lead into your things real quick. I'll just wait. So in that article, I don't have to bring it up. I'll just say it ends by saying because this all started around 2012, it's very obviously not an evolution. We're not getting physically dumber or brains are not cognitively dumber. So what is having to do with like the way we're learning the way our environment we're in, the way the access to the phones and so it's changeable, which means, yeah, the hopeful thing of it is like we can change it. Our policy or whatever we do can make it more likely. So you have this idea here from becoming an alpha. Right. Right. Entrute Tate School. So is this the solution? Wait, is this entertains forms? As for the school. These are alpha Tates three commitments. Okay. I'm sorry. I had to wait a whole 25 minutes. Talk about AI. But we're back to AI dude. All right. Let's talk about how the eyes can make everything better. And there's literally no downside, right? There's some. I can't think of any. Okay. So I think there is a, uh, uh, an important premise to start with, which is that one-on-one tutoring of a student is shown to be vastly more effective. And there's been a lot of studies by this. I found one about you from the University of Chicago. Mm-hmm. But the difference between having a teacher in front of a group of people who is giving the same lecture and the same broad lesson to everybody versus a one-on-one tutor is massive difference. And we all know this, right? That's 100%. That's why rich people pay for tutors for their kids. And then it always makes them do way better in school, right? So if we agree with that premise, which has been around been known for decades and decades and decades, uh, if we could transform our education system to be more like a one-on-one tutor experience, that could have incredible benefits for kids. So there are now studies going on with, um, basically people using AI LLMs to have an AI tutor, essentially. So this is in early stages. These are going to get way better. But even there's some studies in Nigeria and Ghana. One of them is crazy in Nigeria. They had students in a six-week program for one hour a day after school. They talked to this LLM chatbot to help them learn English. And they tested at the end. The six weeks was equivalent to two years of typical learning. That is how big of a difference having a tailored experience was. They did math in Ghana. Kids were given an hour of this AI math tutor on WhatsApp. And over eight months of doing this one hour a day, it was an extra year of learning. Like these are crazy gains when you can tailor education to a specific person. So alpha school, I only found out about this recently. It's this school in the US. There's like nine campuses, something like that. And there's some like prominent tech people who's like kids are in these things. Their premise for their school is there are two hours a day of actual school. Two hours a day of not be, don't be a beta. Yeah, not be a beta. Yeah, read, you're Russia, brew. You sling dick. You smoke that marijuana. They know what alpha school. Yeah, you don't know how shit about weed, ain't it? Look at his smoke fucking. No, look at LLM, you're a bad guy. She's those up every day. She hits the bog. She's fucking, you watch her throw a brawn video. She's a fucking alpha. You're right. She's an alpha. So, so this school, their premise is you have two hours a day. That's it of really tailored learning. Their teachers are no longer considered teachers. They are guides and their goal is to be these one on one mentors of each student, which are offering support and guidance and motivation for the student to work with this AI tutor to have really tailored education to them. And the testimonies from kids are like, like this one, I don't have to stick to just second grade. I don't know if you've heard and fourth grade content too, right? Like kids can go at their own rate for all these different topics. And then the rest of the day, they spend doing all of these whatever activities they're interested in. So they can like try to run their own business or they do some sort of outdoor activity or pottery or whatever they feel like whatever's going to make them the biggest alpha. So this is interesting. I always learned about this recently, but apparently the results of this are insane. Like the scoring that these kids are doing is vastly higher on average than a traditionally educated kid in the Texas region. And it's wild to think that like two hours and I imagine myself in school and like how much of schooling was me just forcing myself through this slog. And if it was tailored to me, like now I learn it like a hundred times the rate I used to because I tailor everything to my interests and largely use AI to help me do that. And I'm very optimistic about us potentially transforming education. That is separate from phones, which I don't think kids should have in school. So I want to say, I just want to say I have used this a lot. I mean, I was doing it. I was like, no, I'm not actually not. You went to alpha school. I'm actually graduated school. I'm in beta school. It's different. It's sadly talked to the like once you broke out of the matrix. But you sort of put me on to this and I've been doing it more and it works in legitimate. I'll put in an article that I want to talk about on stream. I'll have it summarize the whole thing, but not summarize it. I'll have it quiz me. So all I really article and then I'll put it into the thing and I'm like, hey, just check my knowledge. And if you do the voice mode, like I have a conversation about the article and if I'm like, this is my takeaway, they're like, well, actually, you know, it'll like correct me or like, it's like, it's like a really smart person. I'm talking to you that knows what I'm trying to learn and just gives me feet. I mean, I can actually see what you're talking about. I've tried it for a second and it does work. And that way when I go live and someone asked me that question, I've had this, like, I'm prepared for it in a way that I couldn't have done just by myself. Like it does. There is potential there. I've learned history, programming, a new language, like learning Japanese are all easily 10 times the rate at which I used to learn things 10 years ago using AI. It is feedback. It is wild. It's not just feedback. It's that it's custom tailored to you, right? Imagine a teacher who's explaining the article to you, but there's 30 people who all have their own questions and you get lost in what I'm lost on. I get an immediate answer. Right. And you can tailor it to you. I mean, imagine again, kids who are like, like my teacher friend was saying, like, kids don't seem to be as motivated nowadays. And what I would hope is that AI tools or whatever modern education tools we use, whether it's AI or not, can be tailored. So this kid who's terrible at focusing on math, can it, it can be rephrased in some sort of game that's related to Fortnite or their favorite characters or a weird like movie thing in a way that actually gets their attention, right? At a level that matches their specific type of learning. Exactly. Right. Right. Have you dug? Have you seen the wire? Yes. I don't know if you know, and can't go 15 minutes in real life without bringing up the wire. He forces it into every conversation. It's because it's great. We've made it two whole episodes. I thought without this problem. And now it's bad. It's a great show. But you might remember you've seen the wire. Have you not? Yeah. You know the beginning. I've seen it through your description of every line. The famous scene, the famous scene at the beginning of season four, when Snoop is buying the nail gun in the store. And the whole thing is that like Snoop, you know, had Snoop grown up in maybe a better environment is actually a very intelligent person who knows what they need, knows how to ask questions and has like a very in-depth conversation of like how I specifically need this type of tool that would be best suited to hide the bodies and vacant buildings. Yeah, they're buying the thing to hide dead bodies. But, and I, this is silly example of, I do think like catering, catering, catering, like knowledge and learning to specific situations that best fit like the kid so that they best understand them is totally the way to go. Even like just having individual time is so important. Like I remember when I was a younger kid in like fifth grade. And I think there was a brief period of time where I went to a private school. And in that school, there was like a subset of people within the class that they pulled out of class to like work on basically like the next grade's worth of material because we already knew that they exist in material. We were nerds. So, but you know, at public schools, those opportunities were like few and far between, at least that US public schools, right? And like I said, when you look at public education in a lot of other countries, they start to take these more like refined approaches to different students so that they're working on something that they are more invested in. I think that this is kind of awesome. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Like if you were, if you're doing this through, I don't know, in a classroom that is like deployed by the teacher or the school rather than like on the, at the kids like phones at an individual level. Right. I think that's, this is really cool because I think at least as if you took this all out of the world of like technology and you just go back far enough in time, I think again, these were the same conversations about education that people are having like 10, 20, 30 years ago about how to help students succeed. And this is like a tool that allows that to happen. I want to talk a little about the negative side of AI though, it's not this in education. And I've been hearing this all over. There's a good article about it, but also I've talked to my, I had my chat like come up and some stories. And the level of cheating, especially in college level courses right now with chat GBT is ramping. Yes, it is, it is, yeah, it is viral. I mean, you're saying they're breaking out of the psychic prison. And maybe that that that means the whole system is just, it doesn't work in this, in this area. But like the structure of it is still there and it's teetering. It's not teachers are frustrated. They're, they're grading like 80% chat GBT papers. They know that student did no time into. And the students are also reporting that like, okay, so let's say you're a student and you want to try hard. Well, you're worried that if you don't use AI to cheat, you're going to fall behind this kid that does. If you're, if you're in college, you're literally suffering because of the curve. Right. Yeah, there's a curve. And then also like you hear the stories of like people graduating. It's a tough time now to find if you get bad grades, you're where you're going to graduate and not be. So you're like almost incentivize hard to cheat because the, the thing can write better than you on a lot of things. Right. So now it's like this race to the bottom where everyone is cheating at all time. I mean, it's getting exponential. And now they're going into job interviews and they're cheating in those like they're, they're having the AI auto listen to the job question and then just reading the end. I mean, it's getting, it's getting, it's breaking the whole system. It's breaking like every way of measuring human ability and talent and that structure that existed before. And I don't have the answer, but like that is a downside of it. That's coming really quickly. Yes. Well, I think this is a longer term strong positive. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Now that's my, I'm not going to pretend like no AI is straight up destroying our current education system. Like straight up. And I think there's a world where we can go, okay, long term, this like things like this alpha school could be really positive. I, I, I have an education from one of the best computer science schools in the country and a computer science degree from it. And I think that education quality was pretty bad overall. And I am not heartbroken if the fairly shitty way of having us learn and test our learning knowledge, which had almost no correspondence to who went on to actually be successful and making it in fact in the world. I'm not that heartbroken if that system fails. I'm not that heartbroken. If doctor, if, if professor Brian Harvey can't fucking grade our scheme of projects as well anymore, I don't get it. Harvey getting shade 15 years later. Yeah. Well, no, he's got this famous, he's got this famous video about not cheating. And he's right morally, like obviously morally, I'm not, I'm not supportive of cheating or anything, but, but it's, it, the current structure is fucked for sure. And I think what I hope and think is and will happen is that we can, we can push it towards these really tailored experiences. But it's not, I don't like the, the, the paradigm of like all the kids go to high school and then they take the SAT and that number is how smart you are. It's like that shit is going to end. That's going to end. It's going to be your specialized and certain things and you can pursue those things with a lot of like individual focus. Yeah. I think this actually comes back to the first episode when we're talking about AI in a way, because, but this is hitting education. I would say sooner or more heavily than the way it's hitting the job. It's like a like brain trained. Like it's the same issue when we were talking about how well, what is the consequences of like AI on the future of the way we work, right? And the big consequence is like, well, AI is going to replace all these jobs. But if those people can't move to new jobs because AI is also capable of replacing those jobs, then there's this catastrophic effect on the way like society is structured right now. Yeah. And but it's have, this is the same situation. It's like new tool is not like complimentary to the way education is currently structured. Or have been done for decades, I mean, for a long time. But the Z construction is happening already. So I think the answer, like when I think about how what I fucking learned in business school is basically you had a business school. Yeah. I went to business school and I studied finance and I studied marketing. And I nothing, almost nothing of what I learned is applicable or helpful in my life. Except for and all of the experience that I gained by being in university was I leveraged a lot of university resources to like start to start a business and run eSports events. Yeah. Doing actual things is the only way to learn by like running that company and I don't like regret going to college for those reasons. Like I did learn a lot through those ways. And there were exceptions in my classes where I learned about stuff that I thought was really interesting. Overall, like I didn't take that much away from it. And this like tailored education experience. That was more expensive. Yeah. I mean, for kids nowadays, it makes no sense. For the average young person going to college right now, it's like the price has only gone up. Yeah. The quality is going down. Everyone is cheating. Like the quality of your degree means less because there's so many false positives. People are cheating too. It's like, you know, like it's it's it's this really tough time to be figuring out what the fuck to do. I don't envy people who are younger. People are like 18 right now. It's like insane. I don't really learning more about it by talking to some of them and it's like, I don't, I feel like in 10 years, maybe we figured some of this out and they're having this, but I feel like this, this window is so bad. This window is socks. Yeah. I again, don't want to downplay that. Yeah. I'm telling them really. We'll just do this or what you know, like parents that don't understand how much it's changed. I don't know. It's just interesting. I think this specific use case is really is really cool. Like to me, if if this is like I think about the language learning example you gave, like you have been learning Japanese. That's how Ludwig's been studying Japanese. And in the time that he said he's been using chat GPT, it is from my outside perspective as somebody who knows like a little Japanese, like very little from studying it in college is, oh, wow, he's improved a lot in the period of time that he's been using that instead. And I think there, I think there is really cool use cases of it. Because as somebody who's the, you know, from that first episode, the AI screw it in there, if you will, I hear to screw it in eyes and like I do think the cheating, the cheating epidemic right now is terrible. Like the situation is literally devolving before us. I'm really excited about something like this. You heard this Steve Jobs quote is a long time ago. It was like him talking about the future. He's like Alexander the Great learned everything he knew from Aristotle. Aristotle was like his private tutor. And he's like one day we'll be able to put all of Aristotle's teachings into a computer and create a digital Aristotle that can be anyone's tutor. And I thought that was really, I mean, first of all, it's a credible foresight for 84 or when he said it or whatever, but like there is something to that of a kid having the compounding knowledge of the world privately for whatever, like in whatever you're interested in, if it's Japanese or whatever. I mean, that is cool. I do see that being a positive thing once it can get figured out. What's society adapts to it? But yes. This is what I said in the first episode. New technology, it's destructive at first and then you start getting the gains and we are currently in the destruction phase and it's going to be hard and scary and terrible. And I again, to repeat myself, I am not saying the terrible stuff isn't happening or won't happen, but I just want and hope that people can also acknowledge how much good there is down the road. And then hopefully we try to maximize that. Minimize downside. Yes. Yeah. But it's fucked right now for sure. It's just so. I mean, if you're 18 or you're like, you have high school and COVID and now you're dealing with cheating and cosplay. It's bad. Well, you're just getting fucked. I'm trying to reach for like what might be like what are more negatives or like what is the potential argument to this use case specifically? And if I would maybe if I was a teacher, I would be seeing this and be one, maybe a little insecure about my job and be like, am I, is this the process of me like getting replaced? What place do I have in this system now? Do you know, just a does a teacher turn from a person that stands in front of a classroom and teaches like a group of 30, 40 kids into somebody that's basically like an AI manager and emotional support. Yeah. The description they have is pretty decent. So it's at alpha school teachers shift from traditional roles like grading and writing lesson plans to supporting students, emotional and motivational needs and teaching life skills. Just like, yeah, I mean, that's a very optimistic description. But in theory, like, yeah, and those are the most impactful teachers that I had as not the ones who wrote really good lesson plans. It's one that we like really tailored to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I will say it's, I think it's really important for there to still be like guidance and structure from from the school and that because when I was in high school, I had this class I was a part of that was you could get into instead of English and it was called, this is not a public school too. It's called rise. I forget what it stood for. But the idea was you had the autonomy within that class to kind of decide whatever you wanted to work on. And the dramatically, I would say good examples of how that time was used was one girl that graduated a few years before me worked really hard, opened like a coffee business using the time that she was in that class. And then she got into like an Ivy League school. And there was other examples of people in that class becoming really successful. I think I struggled a bit more in that environment. Like even though I was a really successful, I fucked off. Like I spent like half of that. I spent half of that year, first year down like finding YouTube music and learning how to like I basically spent a bunch of time learning how to pirate music at school because I can do it. That's alpha right there. It's not to say that that like program didn't have any use, but I feel like that's like that was supposed to be this opportunity for me to grow and succeed in a direction that I that I couldn't in a normal class. And I think that opportunity is really important, but I could have used a little more guidance. Yeah, a little more structure, a little more guidance, especially for some kids, it makes sense. You know, also could you use structure guidance? This show? This show. Let's move on. To drama. Guys, it's been drama drama drama. I'm sorry, tech bros. We are now moving on to Tesla. It's time for Doug Doug to call out Mark rober. Yeah, you need to do it. We need a personal. We need an enemy for this podcast. Yeah. That's all good podcasts of enemies. Okay. This is interesting. Interesting. Interesting timing because last week we talked a whole lot about Tesla versus Waymo, which is basically the difference between cameras in a car versus cameras and LiDAR in a car. LiDAR being lasers that shoots around and it can like see what's going on irrespective of whether there's light in the camera or there's fog or whatever else. So what two days later, I think Mark rober giant science, you tober, if you don't know, very family friendly. It makes this video where he compares Tesla to another company, Lumenar, who makes LiDAR. So basically just does a bunch of tests of this exact thing of a car. Tesla. Yeah, timing is crazy. A car that just does cameras versus a car that has this LiDAR system built in. And so he puts out this video and somewhat predictably the Tesla fails several of these things and the LiDAR system succeeds at all of them. For example, if there's like super bright lights in the car, I forget exactly which ones Tesla fail that failed like half, but like super bright lights or rain that is falling from a bunch of hoses that completely obscures the vision, right? And then the last one is he went through a fake cartoon painted wall. So he's like, and if you, if you're looking at the video, you can see it. He drives through a wall that is painted to look like the background. This is not something that happens in real life. But the point of this is like there is a physical object on the road and the laser LiDAR system absolutely can detect it. But the cameras can't because the cameras it just looks like the road is continuing, right? So he did this test and it's very fun and dramatic. I thought it was interesting. The response to some of this. So this was one of the most prominent criticisms I saw. I don't know who Sawyer Merritt is, although in his bio it says investor of Tesla. So I think he's slightly biased. Sure. But there's, you know, the timing of this was so interesting. And he posted this video, Mark Robert posted this video and then on Monday, Tesla stock drops and Luminars stock, who makes the LiDAR that he showed off increased 25%. Oh my God. It's a big, two days later, it peaked at a 50% increase. So let's see Mark Robert, why don't you post your Robin Hood account? Yeah. So Mark Robert said he followed up and he had to do the criticism. He was like, we did not receive money from Luminar. But Luminar stock goes way up. What Luminar does, they don't make cars, but they make the LiDAR system that they're trying to sell to cars. So they're trying to make a standalone LiDAR system. So this guy, Sawyer Merritt, comes in and is voicing some of the big criticisms against this video Mark Robert does. The first up is that he doesn't actually use Tesla's full self driving technology. He uses autopilot. So autopilot is like every Tesla car basically has this and it's like a highway driver assist. It just like keeps you in the lanes and whatnot. And it is supposed to break and stop you from hitting things, but it's not full self driving. There is as of the last like five years, there's full self driving, S F D that Tesla's have. And that's the new thing that is meant to be self driving. So right out the bat, it's kind of strange. He just straight up didn't use Tesla's advanced system at all. He used the old one from five years ago that is not meant for things like this. There's also inconsistencies in the video. So he like post this clip on YouTube due to criticism of him driving through the wall with the Tesla. The Tesla just smashes through it. But he activates the autopilot mode like three seconds before going to the wall like really late. And that impacts it. Whereas with the LiDAR car, they activate it way down the runway. And there's like tons of time for the car to realize there's a wall there. Not only that, he showed, he post this raw footage and says like, this is the raw footage. That's how you know I didn't fake this. But then in the video, there's a different clip where he activates the autopilot earlier in the runway at a different time. So basically they did multiple takes and then spliced them together in the YouTube video, which is just kind of strange and weird. And there's other things people, you know, being like, why was there a child that you ran over afterwards? And obviously the answer to that is it's dramatic and fun. That was to say, that's number five was dumb to include because it's like, it's just kind of funny to do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, I mean, I really, I think the point is like he, I think Mark Grober is an extremely talented guy. I don't think this was well intentioned, but it is, I think, objectively misleading. The video is titled, can you trick a self driving car or can you fool a self driving car and then does not use Tesla's full self driving capabilities? And then basically stacks the odds against it and doesn't give a whole lot of clarity around like, hey, we're doing a bunch of tests and we are giving Tesla as many disadvantages as possible. Disclaimer again, I don't love Tesla. Neal on must God damn, but I am, I am at least voicing some criticism. And so, you know, this, I would, I would go so far as to say most of the people criticizing this are clearly angry Tesla investors who want to believe the cool aid. You know, I'm not convinced this is some big scandal or whatever, but it was kind of weird and interesting how much of a market impact this video for Mark Grober had as well as the fact that objectively, he gave a lot of disadvantages to Tesla. It's a little weird. So that, that was a little bit of my thought was you, you as a YouTuber making this video might not have been paid by the other company might not necessarily want Tesla to be the party to fail. But if both cars just handle both situations equally fine and you don't put any effort into it past that, you've made a pretty boring YouTube video. Right. And I think from an entertainer's perspective, I can understand why he might have made these decisions if the criticisms are accurate. And I, it, it kind of starts to walk this line of like, how much duty do you as like an entertainer, but also like a science YouTuber that I think commands a lot of respect within the space. Yes. Uh, he's a NASA engineer or was a NASA engineer like, I'm going to do my best to defend Mark over here. But I don't, I do agree that I think the most damning crisis in a means that you should have used full self driving. Right. That's why far the big guy is like he literally used the outdated system because not meant to be self driving and made that his comparison in a video called can you pull us out of the latest and right. Right. And I have, like, I have a, a Volkswagen that came out a few years ago and I have this system like that keeps me in the lanes and stops me from hitting cards. You know what I mean? Like, but I wouldn't expect it to succeed in this situation. So I think that's, yeah. Well, so here's the core thing is like, first of all, what is results line up with is essentially equivalent to what you said in your breakdown of light R versus cameras and their different capabilities and different strengths, including fog and right lights. Yes. And so it is reasonable that if this test were to be run again, even with FSD, this could still be a problem with the wide R versus cameras. Like, it needs to be tested again. Most likely the results would be the same. Yeah. But the fact that he disadvantaged his life is unnecessarily, it's like, why did you do that? Like, now there is so much criticism because genuinely, it's not fair. Like, yeah. And then the only other thing I want to mention is a lot of people are pointing out like, if you see right here, see, see the rainbow road goes on. Yeah. It turns it on late for sure, but it's on. Turns off. And that is because people are postulating, and this is a rid of good article on this, is that Tesla's have been shown in multiple instances to automatically turn off before an accident to change the to to to muddy the waters around whether autopilot was engaged during accidents. Dude, it's like when Disney takes the bodies out of the park before they're declared dead. Oh, that's good. I don't know if they this is rumored. This is rumored because if you pause this footage, yes, when Mark rubber drives through the wall, it's just Mark rubber driving. Yeah. That autopilot's off. So fucking check. That's what I'm saying. No, that works. That has been shown. Like, there's a, there was a Tesla that drove into a, it was a white truck, and I thought it was the horizon or as a blue truck, I thought it was a horizon. It drove into it. And the person died. But they said autopilot was off at the time. You're laughing a lot of this guy's. I'm not touching you. No, if I was a truck driver, I would not paint my truck to look like a horizon. Like some fucking lunatic. It's a bad idea. I would paint people killing themselves in my truck. It's probably not the smartest trucker move. But this guy dies. And every time this happens, they kind of muddy the waters. Like, autopilot wasn't engaged at the moment of crash. But it was engaged, you know, seconds before. And it like, if it's too late to break, and it's, but it's still a sexual collision, it does turn off. And they say it's for the reason of like, let's give back to the humans. They have a last chance. But it feels very muddy the water. So while I agree with you, I really do. I was kind of disappointed because like I feel like Mark Rober had a real chance to like have an open shut slam dunk on LIDAR. And instead because of these errors, it like, it muddies the water. So no one can, but I, I also think like this points out, this footage is pointing out what a lot of court cases have already shown, which is like, this is a real thing that Tesla was getting investigated before before Doge wiped out a lot of the investigative areas that were looking into this. That's just coincidences. Oh, allegations. I'm ambivalent on it. I wish they would do. I mean, he's getting so much pushback. Maybe he will do a follow up or do some kind of like more strenuous tests or maybe interesting. Yeah, I would love to like, no more detail. But there's a whole other topic, which I would need. I don't know enough about, which is the legal side of full self driving, which is if a full self, if a waymo hits and kills a person who is at fault, like who get what happens? Like, we just put the car in jail or is it the engineers or is it like what happens, man? So that's a whole crazy video recommended after your talk last week. I guess I was looking more into it. And it's like a waymo that's getting pulled over by a cop on a cop on foot and his phone uniform was like, stop the waymo stops. And then like a little driverless pizza delivery bot is like rolling by. I guess distracted. And then the waymo just fucking be like that. And it's like, how do you? You just know what to do. He's like an old copy. It's no idea how to deal with all these robots around him just moving on their own. It's just the world's getting so crazy. Things are changing so fast though. It's interesting. That's so funny. Anyway, what do you think will happen? I don't know what Mark Robert does next. I don't even know if he's upset about it. The video's doing great. I feel like Mark Robert criticism. The problem is that even if the pushback is really big, it's kind of like when Mr. Beast gets black, it's you're you're pretty insulated. Like at the core of it, even if a million people are shedding on you, right? You drop the next video to like 10 million plus people that have no idea this drama even exists. Right. And that's like Mr. Beast. No, I don't think it's there's a lack of accountability in it. But Mr. Beast has kind of like run to that level, right? Where it's like even if the internet, there's a huge pocket of the internet that's up his head at him. It's like a hundred million people still watch the next like yacht video. Right. Right. Because they just don't even know that this is a controversy in the first place. And this is I mean, all things considered, this is pretty niche. Yeah. This is not a huge deal. But it is an interesting as this conversation goes on with cars and whether we should have lidar in them or if Tesla can pull off this thing. And Tesla is saying right now that they're going to launch fiber cabs in June of this year. Like that's in three months. And there's 25 this year. Yeah. So supposedly in three months in Texas, they're going to be launching cars that don't have a driver in them, which is from what we are aware of way too soon. So it's this is an ongoing discussion. I think it's going to happen and be very relevant over the next couple of years is like, what exactly are our standards as Americans or humans who are near cars? It's like how good it has to be. You know, it's like it's going to be so interesting. But what were they only say? Because you, I mean, you put me on all this is that, you know, you made the story that Tesla decided early on that light I was too expensive. Yes. And when they made that decision, again, too expensive and also technically not the best solution. Sure. Like cameras just focusing on that. Right. It's both, which is important to recognize. But yes. And I said that my understanding is that LiDAR was like as expensive as up to $15,000 of additional shit you had to put on the car. Yes. And now at the time of Lumen R and all this, the cost is going down to like 500 to a grant. Like it's dropped from that cheap. Yes. It's gotten way too used to be tens of thousands. And now it's hundreds is the estimates. Wait. And so in the future, you can imagine it getting insanely, you know, if that continues, we get it down to even if it was at that price. Like if that's the price that it takes that on to a system to be that safe, then think of the shareholders. How is that? He's making a good point. As a business major, I'm actually switching right back to that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, but it feels like it feels like a needless cost cut when it's getting this cheap. I think the LiDAR stands or the LiDAR stands are starting to make waves. I don't know. It feels. It's worth reiterating because I think a lot of people miss this point is that it's not just cost. It is the bigger argument is that having your engineering team focused on just a vision approach is going to allow you to do it more effectively than to spread them out across a bunch of tech that has to coordinate. That is incredibly hard to do. So it's not like you just stick LiDAR and you got plus one stats in your car. Like it becomes much more complex. So it's I just want to. Yeah. So I just want to I want to reiterate that like even if LiDAR costs. Doug is my AI tutor trying to make it like. Yeah. Yeah. This is good. Maybe I didn't understand this and then I wanted to stick LiDAR on like my Honda Civic and I can. No, it drives itself now. I just paid the 500. This works. I put LiDAR. As far as I can tell, if LiDAR cost one dollar, Elon would not put them in Teslas because he thinks the better approach to actually achieving full self driving is to have a simpler vision based approach that you just get that. Well, again, he says it's a software problem, not a hardware problem. That's it. Okay. That's the thing. One more thing anti LiDAR thing I want to say, this is my most pro Elon argument yet is I read that one downside of LiDAR is that if everybody has LiDAR, they interfere with each other. So if every car in the road using LiDAR, the amount of laser, I mean, that sounds so boom right. I don't know. The amount of laser is out there. My interrupt the data collection or cause a problem. I get I don't know if this is true, but my understanding is that LiDAR could be conflicting if there was like everyone doing it all the time. Again, we'd have to look more into this, but that could be a problem down the road where we go, all right, that's great. And then there's causes zone issues. But then all the cars are crashing all the time. We kind of cool though. Like fast and the fear is we could ship all of the LiDAR lasers using a fleet from the Jones acts. Oh my God. Which was created is after World War one. Well done. Well done. Well done. Well done. Well done. Well done. Well done. What is it? Why is not to do it? Because of the kids. What is the difference between you and I? I don't know what you guys are talking about. I like it. I like it. Us not getting into this so we can have something that me and you know, but yeah, like a little secret. Yeah. Referencing around it like all the Jones act. Oh, this is a classic Jones act. But on your mobs. I don't think you deserve this. Teach me about the Jones act. Well, teach me your AI Tudor is loading his Jones act. Well, I thought this would be interesting to talk about because I've heard about this law coming up in a bunch of videos explaining shipping logistics in like different parts of the US. So I watched a video about like, oh, how Hawaii handles there. Like shipping between islands or from the mainland and then a video about basically the decline of Puerto Rico and how the Jones act affects Puerto Rico. And then I was like, oh, this is really interesting. And I think at a time when like a, you know, a terrorist especially, but I would say protectionism in general is a big talking point of, you know, the Trump administration, the hands of Trump. Like the idea that we're isolating as Americans and becoming better independently and we don't need to rely on this like global economic system anymore things like that. So the Jones act is it started in 1920. It was put in place in 1920 in the wake of World War One. Okay. The Jones act is a law that requires any like water-based shipping. So even on a river to be done by a ship that was built in the US owned by a US company and crewed only by Americans. USA, you are my country. Very pro USA law. And the idea was in the wake of World War One. So any ship that's delivering to America or what do you mean? Any ship, so any ship that is delivering goods between American ports. Okay. I was like, because China wouldn't send a ship here with, okay, so American, America to America. So the way, the way this law, an example of how this law affects things now is say there's a Chinese shipping company, right? Yeah. And they have a boat that they built in Korea. Okay. And that boat picks some stuff up in Long Beach. And it is not allowed to pick up stuff in Long Beach and then bring it to Seattle. That's a league. No, where else in America? No, where else in America? Can they make a round trip to Cuba and stop there and then? Okay. So that's the weird thing is, yes, technically. If they interrupt the trip by going somewhere else first, they can then go to America. Nobody don't. Because there's not a ton of like use cases where that is super effective. There's a similar law that applies to passenger boats and they do do that. That's why all the fairies that go from like Washington to Alaska, stop in Vancouver. All of them. They have to like ping pong between countries. Because they're not, they're not on Jones Act compliant ship. That's so funny. So basically the idea was if we put this protectionist law into place, the US will always have a thriving, maritime shipping industry that is not only good for America on the whole, but is good for like military and like security reason. So when we get into a big naval war, we have like a shipping fleet to deploy. Okay. But what they didn't plan for is that there were no downsides. They were and there were no downsides and that end of the archeriving and the American shipping industry. The problem we've arrived at is they didn't expect global shipping to like blow up as much as it as much as it did in the future after the fact. And the love is cute little. They make fun of them on the yard. So much. They watch this. Yeah, because they never see them like this. So they watch this show and they're like, he's got his little stuff. Usually he's talking about piss and shit. Yeah, piss and shit. I mean, the yard is just like mystery science theater. They're just watching our show making fun of it. That's all they do. But ships started getting built in other places outside of the US because it was way more cost effective to do that. Yeah. Can I say that? Yeah. Fifty five percent of all ship building globally is done in China. Yeah. And dude, get that get this. And as of 2018 and this was the trajectory is still going up. So the 21% of ship building happens in China, Korean and Japan. So the entire like shipyard industry, like ship manufacturing industry in the US, it just doesn't exist anymore. All of these companies went out of business and they don't have enough Jones act compliant clients to like keep a business. There's enough demand for that. So it was funny because when I was reading through this, there was like the paper that I was reading was from 2020 and it was talking about how few shipyards are left in the US that even make these types of ships anymore. And it was like and one of the few remaining ones is about to close. It's called like the Philly the Philly shipyard. So I looked up the shipyard, the name of that shipyard now, the Hanwa Philly shipyard. A true American institution in 2024. It had been about Philly, Eagles or Hanwa shipping. It had been bought by a South Korean company. Oh, sorry. Yeah. And it's South Korean company. So isn't it? That's it was really funny to like, oh, that happened. If they got bought out. And the consequences of this in short are that we have a really limited supply of compliant boats that are even able to fulfill this purpose anymore. They're more expensive to use. So for any goods that like Hawaii has to get, for example, or coastal states in general, the price of goods shipped on those things is like really, really expensive because there's only a couple companies that even do this type of shipping. So there's a way lower supply. These are their way less efficient and they charge way more because they basically have monopolies on the other side. Yeah, there's no competition. And this this grand like shipyard industry that was meant to produce like having this giant fleet and all these these companies like protected actually has crumbled and fallen fallen apart. And the people that suffer the most are like a really explicit example is the Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and like devastated Puerto Rico a couple of years ago, right? And they were turning around ships for the Jones and yeah. And that was a big thing is like they couldn't get emergency supplies because the Jones act affects those ships. They had to they're requesting to like lift the law for a period and Trump eventually caved and lifted it for a week. But he said basically the companies that benefit from this like really don't want us to do this. That's like and during Hurricane Katrina, they did the same thing is like this law is so harmful that during disasters, they literally temporarily remove it. Right. Otherwise a few companies will steer charge. Yeah. But even like day to day like things like fuel supplies are either way more expensive or less accessible. Or these places turn to maybe foreign countries instead because they can offer those goods at a way lower price. So you're losing like the economic benefit from that. Yeah. And then also anything that you would ship over water that might be cheaper normally gets pushed into like other transportation industries in the US that are like further burden like the supply of shipping space in the US brought to you by like things like trucks, trains, etc. It stretched thinner because the boats aren't really an option. So I see two options. One is we as a podcast advocate for the repeal of the Jones Act, which would be pretty cool with us. We do like a really powerful or two, we start an American own shipping company take advantage of this monopoly situation. That's what our Patreon tier is. You get to ride on our boat. You get to be the crew on the boat as well as your Americans. I'm your American. You're the pretend and they pay us to work on the boat. So we can undercut the current monopoly. This is big. This is companies think about this. Um, like think about this, think about our plan. Right. Why didn't they make a podcast? But the book companies had just opened the Patreon and asked people to work for them. They could have made some real money. But the reason the reason that I was thinking about this a lot and why I thought it was interesting is because while the, the benefactors of this would be the remaining people that get who ships in the US in the US and keep your job. And honestly, if foreign companies were competing, the remaining shipping jobs that exist here albeit very few wouldn't exist at all because they'd be getting out competed by who actually staff ships now, which is like Filipino and like Indian workers who are much cheaper to pay. Right. Um, and the boats cost way less. And the boats cost way less than half for a third of the price or something to take a boat in China or Korea for better quality. Yes. We just, we just have all behind on all expensive boats that you then have to use to move something from Puerto Rico to Florida. Yeah. That's what we have to. And the new and an example of like an industry that existed, basically existed way smaller scale back then is like natural gas. They get moved around on big tanker boats. American tanker boats do not exist. There are none. They, they, they literally doesn't exist. So a place like Puerto Rico that might be able to get like natural gas, which we produce, I don't know if you know this, we've been drilling. We've been drilling. We're kind of a natural gas goat. And you can send American gas to Puerto Rico at like a really cheap rate, but because this law exists that you can't do that. And then they, so they, a lot of that excess gas would get sold to like other countries and then Puerto Rico's buying their gas from other countries. Um, there's so much of that happening. There's so much of like we put, uh, like a restriction on buying Russian or something. And then Russian will just goes to India and then go from India to, you know, like if Europe restricts it, they just go to India and then sell it to Europe. The circumvention of tariffs is so interesting. Well, like Vietnam is like thriving because it is not China, but you can just put something from China to Vietnam, slap a sticker on it. And so like there's all this ways of getting around tariffs and protectionism and, uh, it's okay. So okay. I think we can agree this rule is not working, but I personally think that America having some sort of shipbuilding industry is valuable, especially, you know, world where, you know, they're at tensions with China. Having all of it there is kind of boogie in that world. So do you have any thoughts of like what you would do to do? Can you solve this problem for everyone? Yeah. If I could just solve this quickly right now, that's like huge geopolitical issue. Well, that's the thing, right? Is like this law actually has nothing to do with it. I didn't protect it at all. It didn't protect it. It didn't work. And, uh, and so we're, we're in a worse spot. Yeah, that makes no sense. Compared to then even back then. I, I don't, I don't really have the answer. Like you'd have to like, you know, if you, if you, if we're not going to solve the shipbuilding crisis in America, then why are they tuning in, 80? The only thing I can think of is you would have to. The solution is right on the picture. I'm watching the solution is on the picture on you have to do the two or three. We'll tell one person on our boat. One, one lucky tier three subscriber who works on the boat and we'll whisper into them as we send them off into open water. Uh, I, I think I, I would love to hear a better approach or answer. The only thing I can think of is soft similar to like the chips act, right? Like you have to subsidize and like basically invest and spend a bunch of money to make, making a ship in the US cheap enough to make it competitive. That's the only thing you can do. Yeah. And then I know. Yeah. And my understanding is arguably it's like, so this is what we're doing instead of the government subsidizing a shipping industry is we force Americans to pay more to get their stuff shipped and particularly like Hawaii Puerto Rico Alaska. Just have to pay way more for all their shit because it has to be, it has to be shipped on these boats that are old and expensive and there's not many of them. And so the biggest advocates to repealing the Jones Act are Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, anybody who doesn't live in the contiguous United States because you just have to pay way more. So arguably instead of our government subsidizing our shipping fleet, it's Puerto Ricans. Like some of their shipping fleet and just paying. And just paying these three states right to give the money to small dying shipping. Right. Right. Like it is, it is ridiculous. Which are like price doubting and yeah, and you put it that way. It's kind of like we have a Hawaii is like a very, very important thing. A very important state that everybody loves and then we're just like, yeah, but we're going to make it super expensive. If you guys get anything, it's wild. I, I, I would lean more towards a straight up government subsidies because it just, I, I just don't think it makes sense. And I know free markets have downside. But like in this case, I would rather our shipyards have to compete and we have a smaller amount that are actually good rather than what we have, which is a bunch of expensive, slow shitty fleets and then everybody's paying more for stuff. I just don't see how this bad. There's a, there's a funny story about Hawaiian farmers choosing to air in cows to the mainland instead of using boats because of this law. That's like a far, far, far, far, far, far, far. I know it's class. That's what the Wright brothers were imagining. They're like finally. Why it's their cows easily the California. Yeah, it's not like it's, it's not like it's all roses on the other side of this is like, okay, well, what happens when you let like, like full competition take place? It's like, you know, there's a bunch of scrutiny of the quality of work conditions on boats and the low wages you get to pay these people from the Philippines and India that often staff these boats. Like it's not like the other side is like filled with, filled with good. It's just that there's a bunch of people in the US, particularly in those places that suffer because of this decision. And the only people that benefit are the people who have the monopolies on the remaining shipping left and like the people who have jobs at those shipping companies. And at the individual level, I'm sure they would like to keep their jobs. It's kind of, we didn't talk about this on an episode, but we did talk about this together. Was the, like the efficiency of ports in the US versus like the efficiency. Oh, we did that. Those are our first conversations where we're like thinking about this doing this podcast. Yeah. And it's a, you know, there, there was a big, it was when we were at the dinner, like where we were talking about like what we wanted the show to be. And I thought that conversation is very similar. It's like, obviously people want to keep their jobs and do not want to suffer in the wake of a decision that would like repeal this law, right? But how many people are suffering on the other end because the other side, for sure. I think it's like, I don't know the number. I believe it's like either a hundred thousand, between a hundred thousand and like a couple hundred thousand people are employed with by the Jones Act shipping stuff. So it's like you lose that and that's not insignificant. Yeah. That's a lot of people. But then, you know, again, the other side of the coin is there are millions and millions and millions of people in the United States and various areas who are paying way more basically so that those people have jobs. And it's like, is that, do the other, the other thing that I would be more stoked about repealing the Jones Act if Trump was not burning all of the bridges with Japan and Korea who are the only ones who could make our ships if we go to war with China. You know, it's like, I generally am all about free market. But then when you also burn the bridges to the rest of the market, then it's like, you have to be able to make it yourself or you can do both. I mean, that's, that's one thing I've read about a little bit, which is bigger conversation. But like if we go to war as far as my understanding, like America is completely pork right now. Like we can't build ships. We can't build most of our stuff. All the raw materials comes from other countries. Like we just would not be able to build things. And then I don't know if that helps or hurts that if we repeal the Jones Act and then there's more competition. I don't know, man. It's, it's a little dire regardless. Well, hopefully there's no war with China, right? But regardless of that, I think this Jones that is not doing what it was intended to deal with just protect America, she building my ship. You're trying to get it over with. It's the villain. You always are talking shit on my man. She is the go. No, we're buds. Have you seen my discord profile picture? Do you see this? Yeah, you're with profile. I like calling this flag with she's definitely like drew me hanging out with she jumping with with the yard and Chinese flag waving below us and F 35's flying above us. I know what's happening. He's a sleeper agent from China here to destroy our ship building industry with this big propaganda American ships. The law is so bad. It's so bad. It's so bad Chinese. It's already. It's so bad. It's so bad. I opened up my next, no bad. All madderies. I'm going to your little white book trying to spread your lies to the youth. But yeah, I just thought it's, it, one thing it was making me think of as a final note and I would love to hear if people in the audience have like more thoughts about this too is there's something that had I think obviously good intentions would fell apart because of like other factors outside of the law that it could not control. And then the complete purpose of the law was like totally, yeah. So I do wonder if there's, you know, when you look at protectionist legislation in the future, what are the like the little loopholes and potential consequences of of that? So I don't know. It was interesting. No, you had some drama. You had two drama. And we get we can end this on some juicy asterama. Let me hear this. Okay. I don't know what this topic is. I have got juicy drama in the world. Dun dun. Of HR SaaS companies. This is not juicy. This is juicy. This is juicy. Guys, Buckley are software as a service. Right. Like, yeah, like, no, be subscription. No, like they help with payroll. Like, yeah, it's like you get a payroll. He's actually got me. Okay. He's actually got me. You don't know what you're about. I have to browse that shit. Aiden's going to know about all the HR drama. You're not doing it. I'm not talking about it. I'm not talking about it. I'm not talking about it. I'm not talking about it. I'm not talking about it. I'm not talking about it. What do Gusto do this time? Okay. All right. This is all, I swear, this is all real. I'm not exaggerating. Okay. There's a bunch of HR companies. You got Workday, right? Everybody loves Workday. I mean, they all hate it. But any major company has some sort of HR software. It's helps with like employees and contracting and payroll and all this other stuff, right? All this like not very fun stuff, but there's a huge business. Okay. The two of the newer players are rippling and deal. Deal spelled D-E-E-E-E-L. So deal. So these two, they're actually, they're both grown really rapidly. They kind of specialize a little bit in one thing versus the other, but for the most part, it's like here's all the HR tools you need for your business. They're evaluated most recently. It's like a two years ago at 12 billion and 13 billion. They're like neck and neck. Okay. Like ultra competitive. Okay. Okay. And so you might think, yeah, who cares? That's not very interesting. They start beefing. Okay. They start to like pretty aggressively pursue each other's customers, right? Because they go for businesses, you know? And so they're like, they go Nike is, I think, with deals. So Rippling goes is like, hey, we should come over to Rippling. We have a better business, all this stuff. And so at some point recently, deal, and I have it up here, oh, except all the cookies, deal, the one of the two services. They post something called deal versus Rippling on their website. And there it is. It's kind of wrong. Right. Right. Right. We went to coax website and it was just coke versus Pepsi. Then pouring a Pepsi in the trash. Yeah. That'd be guys, trust me. This is the least dramatic. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is the start deal. The HR company post deal versus Rippling. And they're like, we have all these entities, integrations, payment methods, get started. Here's the companies. Deal is rated higher than Rippling in 74% of the shared markets. It's just this straight up. Hey, here's a comparison. This is so funny. It's like the comparing product graph. It's a comparing of like their two subscriptions, except it's their company checking every box and rippling failing over and over and over. It's like automate IT operations. X, no, they can't do it. I like a Mark Rober video though, right? Yeah. Right. Instead of them. All right. So deal throws out a punch, right? And so rippling strikes back. How do you think Rippling would reply? You might think they'll make their own page. No, no, no. What Rippling did is they introduced a snake game. And so they make an actual game of snake where you move around and you have to get little items, right? And they say don't buy snake oil. Deal claims to be the one stop solution for your global payroll needs, but their customers pay the price. Play this game to find out the difference. And then as you play this snake game, I don't know if I can play it on this iPad here, but it shows a claim. Oh, I can't. It shows a claim from deal. And then when you go and you get it, it shows you. The actual thing that they said deals marketing claim pay anywhere, pay anyone anywhere in minutes. Reality could take days to run global payroll. That's brutal. As you play the snake game, each one unlocks a letter for the word mislead. At one point, somebody from Rippling posted screenshot, one of the executives from deal played the game and sent in feedback, which is suck a dick with a big dick ass, uh, a nasty art. So they start, they're not full on beefing. They were always competitors on the market now. I'm just like, oh, I'm making these insane things. This is the Kendrick versus Drake of like, the payroll services of payroll services, except they're, yeah, they're both the guys wearing a Patagonia vest. They're awesome. Yeah. So it's getting pretty intense, right? And you're like, all right, this is funny. And then on Monday, two days ago, the CEO of Rippling releases a tweet and he says, today, Rippling sued deal. Our lawsuit, a ledges that deal cultivated a spy and a foreman, she orchestrated a long running trade theft secret or trade secrets theft. Okay. So let me break down what exactly goes on in this very detailed lawsuit where they break down what happened. They turns out at Rippling, you slack and they have logs for everything somebody does on slack, including which channels they search for and look at. And they find out that there's a, they think a spy and a new employee. Okay. Searching in slack for deal stuff. So he joins Rippling and he just starts searching in every single channel for anything related to deal and any customers that deal has and searching for like, customers that Rippling is trying to get from deal. So he could, so he could look back and they can stop it. And so they're like, we think we have a spy. This employee has nothing to do with this job, but he keeps looking into what deal is doing. Okay. So, so they're like, we want to see if this guy is actually a spy. And so they honeypot him and they make a fake slack channel called D. It's like D defectors. Yeah, D defectors. They make a new slack channel that didn't exist. And they send a letter to deals chairman, CFO and general counsel that says, hey guys, just so you know deal us at Rippling, we have a new slack channel where we talk about all the stuff we have on you. And if you ever mess with us again, we're going to release all of it. We just, honeypot, make this up, right? Within four hours, the alleged spy is now searching for this new channel, which was made specifically for this. So the honeypot works. This guy who is made a spy, immediately searching for this new channel that has not existed a day before. It is all made up. Okay. It gets better. They go to the high court of Ireland and they get a court order that they're going to go take his phone. They show up to his desk with a court examiner, like a court appointed person who is legally authorized to detain this guy. And he runs into the bathroom and locks the door and tries to flush the phone down the toilet. So the guy is banging on the door saying, you are violating court orders. You have to come out right now. He refuses to respond after a while. He finally comes out and you can see here the quote. He says, if you take another step, you're violating court order again. And he says, I'm willing to take that risk. And then he flees the premises. That's crazy. So the spy got away. And he took his phone with him. So he didn't get the phone. They even in the lawsuit, they're like, we looked through our plumbing system and did not find a phone. So that went look for it. Okay. So this is in. This is insane. I told you. The most dramatic thing. And the response from deal is. It's crazy. Right. This is HR companies. And so deals response so far. This is two days ago said weeks after. Okay. So they try to go back on the offensive. And this is basically the end. But weeks after rippling is accused of violating sanctions laws in Russia. And seating falsehoods about deal. Rippling is trying to shift the narrative away. We deny all legal wrongdoing. And so legal wrongdoing. And so they're like, oh yeah, rippling, well, you guys are selling to the Russians. And then it follows up in one of the articles. However, deal itself has also been accused of violating sanctions against Russia according to a lawsuit filed in Florida earlier this year. So both of them are accused of violating sanctions in Russia, which they're using to distract from the spy, which has been stealing trade secrets from rippling. It is insane. It is 50 times funnier than its HR software is a survey. It's the most boring industry with the most stuff. It's going on. Oh, maybe that's fucking awesome. Been a made fun of gusto before this. I've got hit man. I've got hit man. I'm doing fine. Who, who do you think, who do you think blew up in hardstream? Deal, bro. The deal's probably to put the, that's a cover up a different thing. I can't wait to follow up. What's the, is the spy going to arrest it? Is he on the land? Like, I got it. That's what I know. And you hire a spy. This guy is the goat. This guy really didn't crack under pressure. I know. He ran, he was, he tried to flush his toilet and then ran away and said, I'm willing to go to jail with. That's wild. Yeah. I was thinking it was like, early your job at the HR company is not worth all this. It just can't be. Right. Like, how much is deal paying him to that? You're not fighting for like the security of your countrymen. You're, there's no, there's real life spies of crafters. Exactly. There's no like a nationalism of like our security at stake or something. It's, it's for payroll. Men used to go to war. Now they fight for HR companies, right? We need something to galvanize our youth because they're just going to do this instead. They're going to scroll on their phones and they're going to go be a spy for deal. The funny thing about this to me is that they sent this letter, this honeypot letter to deals. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's brilliant. That's a smart. The honeypot's insane. They sent this to only the top people at deal. So this, what are the top people at a senior person at a, at a 12 billion dollar HR company is personally orchestrating a spy in their competitor and telling them, hey, we just got info about the de de fecters channel. I get a thing. Info. Oh, you think the yard all are figured out who our spy is in their discord? What? No, nothing. I just, I hope they don't murder and kill our spy because they're figuring out who is going to be the best. I hope they don't murder and kill our spy because they're figured out it would be like a huge. Okay. Is it real? I'm going to get, you and I are going to get a letter. The yard is found some incriminated evidence against lemonade stands. How did you find this story? Yeah, what did you hear about this? It's Twitter. Man, that's what the hot stuff happens. That's why I think everything about man. Yeah, everything. Everything. You can, you can go to Mars from watching basketball. You can really learn about watching. You can really cover it all the bases right now. Do you guys, I figured it might be nice to close out on a couple, like, you know, we wanted to follow up on a couple topics from the previous videos. It's just a, yeah, it'd be great. Quick, check out the comments. And I think it's what we're saying that I think all of us have spent a lot of times reading some of these great comments people put in the last two episodes. Yeah. Yeah, we've been responding and thinking of it there. And it's been great. I think we super appreciate it. The, that was like the number one thing we were looking for for this, for the show is like well thought out interesting perspectives and thoughts. You'll have it on this one. I'm sure that's cool. I think from the first episode, because we even touched on it again in this one was the, you know, people dealing with the consequences of going through the education system during COVID. Yeah. And a lot of people, I think there was probably the thing we got the most personal, like, responses and anecdotes about it. And I would say the pervasive sentiment was basically negative. People talking about their experience and a lot of people saying things like this, the conversation on socializing post COVID really resonated with me because it was a junior, junior in high school in 2020 and can definitely attest that it altered my abilities and desires to socialize. I was already really introverted. And instead of trying to fight against the isolation, I basically took advantage of it as a way to get used to not needing peers around me. I know now that this is probably a mistake. And I'm paying the price of my social life for it now that I'm in college. I don't know anyone who also went through the hyper isolationist route as I did, but I'm sure they're out there. And from reading the comments, I think that that experience was very, very similar between people. A lot of people kind of maybe not even necessarily having the worst time during COVID, but then coming out of it and then trying to get back to normal and then realizing that everything is. And then, I think that's really the isolationist. There might be the most amount of them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the most that the most there's ever been. And but I really appreciate it because we got a lot of like personal stories that I read through related to that topic and a lot of stories really similar to that one. The one thing I wanted to follow up about from the last episode was on when we were talking about, you know, self driving cars and the potential of like robo taxis and also the idealistic structure of cities with trains and things like that. A few people came out and said that we're just a bunch of city guys. And we don't get it. And our public transport utopia and the fact that we like trains, like all I think we're generally in favor of like, oh, trains are nice to have in cities in a good way around. Seemed to think that we don't think cars should exist in rural America. And that was actually a surprising amount of comments. I wanted to clarify something because I thought it was a good demonstration of what I call good faith versus bad faith arguments. And oh shit. Okay. All right. I didn't know we were going. Oh, there we go. I'm buckling in. But I think it's a really simple example of like I think people jumped to the conclusion that because I want like more trains and less. So we're all this cities. And you heard that? No. If you say I like pancakes, someone on Twitter will say we were fucking having it's waffles. Exactly. We ate about waffles. Exactly. Is when you are listening to us explain a topic or like talk about something and we miss an aspect of the conversation like something doesn't get touched on. And you assume that because it wasn't touched on that we disagree with it that we inherently have the opposition opinion to you. Well, just to clarify, I do want to take your car away. If you live in a rural part of America, I would like you to ride a horse because that's my image of like a cool rural. And that's it. You should have horses in rural America. That's my side. I think you should like if I get something wrong, give us the benefit. I'll give it a doubt. Assume I'm right. Assume that you have it wrong. Right. Yeah. And that's just a basic common decent. Just believe. Just believe. Just believe. He's got a microphone. He's got a microphone. Yeah. There's a microphone. Yeah. I have more subscribers than you. And there's a reason. That's right. That's true. Okay. Yeah. There was there was also obviously a lot of people. There was a. Yeah. I thought that the people we were making fun of that were going to be like Doug Seng. Haslund. Shell. Like there was a couple people like that. And I was like, it was always like a flag of like you didn't make it to the part of the up one. You tuned out at the beginning of the episode. Dude, but two, two, you just ignored the part. The the bomb shell you saved where you're like, and I sold on my Tesla stock today because I don't believe this. I can't say so much. I said to my stream and I said this in the comments. I responded to some of the people that said this. And you're taking the position of like trying to find some defense of what Tesla's doing. It's the harder one for the audience that we're going to interact and have. It's harder to do. It's very easy to be the guy that's like, hey, that's the sucks. You know, it was like, yeah, it is actually easier to condemn the guy who did the Nazi season. It's like, it actually is easier. And we don't even know what it was. Yeah. It's true. And it makes for a much better podcast to have people having differing opinions. And you know what? My heart goes out to all the people in chat who I like. I think we should strive to have a couple like uninformed, loud people. Yeah. That brings light to the comments section. Yeah. I actually thought a good, a good litmus test for this is if you've made it this far in the episode, when you, and you have a comment you want to make, put two asterisks just at the end of your comment, whatever it is. And it's just a sign that you heard this part of the episode. That's the stupidest. I just want to do the deal thing. I just want to see. I'm going to see. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I just want to see this one time. I won't ask for it again. But that conversation came up a lot and I thought I'd, I'd clarify is like, I think I don't know if I've ever met anybody in my entire life that has said, let's get a rid of all the cars in like rural America and suburbia, like legitimately has that opinion. No, I don't either. And I was like, so why would that be ours? And you know, the idealistic form of these things, I think is like, okay, well, you have a really good public transportation system that lets people basically choose to have a car or not if they really want to. Because I think the way cities are structured now, like in LA, in LA, you basically have no choice in practice. Like, it's not literally attacks, but it is attacks on every person because you have no choice. You have to pay for your car, pay for your maintenance, pay for your insurance. And those are expenses that I guess freedom, I don't know, the freedom of choice is giving you. Like, it's not really a choice at all. And the idea is like providing city infrastructure that frees up people from that, people from that, from that decision. And on that note, I'd like you to leave your angriest comment you can as we wrap up episode three of them. But put three hashtags before it. If it's, if you got this far in the video, but the secret three hashtag, right, yeah, yeah. People who just clicked out and made their comment right after I said, if you're a three hashtagger, you can go reply to the two asteriskers and you can be like, you were committed at all. You're a real winner. If you're a three hashtagger, first dibs on the Jones Act boats, you just get the spot. Come out. All right. Was that last one? I think so. So to close it out, I did actually bring a truck, a lemon this time. No, it's not for tired things. We're going to eat this this whole time. That's I've been telling my stream that you're going to eat it in one bite. No, but I've been, you've been saying off camera that it's going to be you. I also bit the styrofoam one. I'll split it with you. All right. Thanks so much for watching. It was great episode. See you next time. Oh, it's just oh, no, they just can't be pleasant. Oh, I don't want a lot of water. Get your hat. Okay. Actually, not hungry. That's for host dog. Are your eyes watering? Oh, that was a good episode. Good episode, boys.\\n\\nDoug, how do we solve building in America without Asian pink? How do I would like to hear the solution? Doug's solution, he's like, he's like cryo chamber leak on you. Like, this is it right here. Fashion. That's that's the it's like the ring. It is the right. No, no, no. Correct the control. I'm the one who can carry the villain care. If you're joining us now, a truck has been learning how to use an iPad for maybe the past 15 minutes. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the living aid stay. We're back to the living aid stay. We're back again. No need for eight in this little No, we can this episode will actually just be a full tutorial on how to use an iPad. You guys have seen children use them at chiles or other restaurants similar. The woke liberals are trying to bring down your liberation day. Today is liberation day. And I will not. Yeah, we're free. We are free. It's liberation day. I know what it's called. I'm your talent. But do you believe it took almost 250 years for America to do liberation? Liberating. Indie. We had Independence Day. But now nobody ever thought to do this. Trump is probably still liberal. Deliberate and the best. OK. I think we're being liberated from cheap products. I just might understand. How about many other things that we'll talk about today in liberation day as well as what we're not being liberated from is expensive housing, which I think does. Yes, I will be I will be talking about the many things, ailing the particularly left-leaning governments and their inability to build things in America, which I am very passionate and annoyed at. Is that going to be a short list? There's actually very few problems. Yeah, it works. And then I think Amy Ross is going to talk about how you want to do a do a adopt a South Korean child. I'm very, I was full set on adopting a South Korean child until I heard the big news, which I'll tell you later in this episode. But I believe we wanted to start with something new, where we kind of go through a lighting round of smaller topics, one mini per topic. Yes. And Doug, Doug has prepared and we wanted to start. I just started this is really funny because like two weeks ago, we said people's attention spans are getting too short and we have to like bring real rigor. And that's what we did that week later. I'm literally texting all my phones right now. This is your phone as we're talking in the show. And you want to add a one minute lightening round topic to the cut. Why do you have to talk? Let's get around. Okay. I'm going to try to give some quick, some quick things here. All right. First off, X AI purchased X. So you know how when Elon bought Twitter a couple of years ago, people like this is a bad idea. This is stupid. How is he going to pay this back? Well, one way that he has an exit strategy is to buy it himself from his own AI company. So he recently did this. There's actually a lot of strategic value to it in terms of having an AI company that directly owns all this data that's going on because most of the others don't. It's what is actually a real competitive advantage to do this. You have 30 seconds to respond. Go. Have you seen the Obama meme where he's putting the metal on himself? Yes. It's Elon Musk paying $45 billion on himself saying this company's worth what he bought. I was going to say I'm sure the evaluation is exactly with the market. There's no bias. Exactly with the market would. Well, you know it's not bias because he asked Grock what it's worth. Just the independent third party on the X AI. Yeah. Loki, I think it's Mark. This is probably one of his only reasonable paths to get Twitter to profitability. I imagine. Yeah, or just to keep it from being hounded by creditors. One minute. Oh, Solid Prince is Daniel. Now this is an American Post-Costat. Okay. Right. This is about Mara. Mara. Mara. American building. Liberation. Liberation's buying. Creation. Liberation. Yeah. Okay. Next quick shot. Open AI, the main AI leader. As you might have seen, everybody is making studio Ghibli images. This is so unbelievably popular and has driven such a surge in people who are now trying out AI products. They said that when Chatsby T launched big, oh my god, crazy Chatsby T changed the world. They got a million signups, a million users in a week. And that was the most fat. I believe the fastest growing app ever. Something like that. The fastest growing thing ever, period. Holy shit. They got one million new viewers users in an hour this week. For the gameplay assets. During this week, there was a one hour period where they gained one million new users. That's not even the free tier. That's people paying at least 20 bucks a month. That is wild. This is growing at a level that is just absolutely obscene. And they're also, they announced open sourcing a model, which is interesting, but there's not enough time for quick shot. Go. I want to know what I help Miyazaki thinks about this so badly. Because I can, I feel like the feedback won't be great. Also, we're at a minute. Squeeze something in. No, it's like if they rolled out a terminator in the stores, people will be like, I don't want to buy that. But if it made yourself, he's a little cuter. They would buy it over. I never fit like this is the proof. They just make it. This is all it takes. It's all it takes. Ray Beyond could pump out bombs with the the studio Ghibli five. Then I, which is not one to one with this situation at all. But it is very interesting to hear the scale at which you've just grown in that short period of time. That's topic. I had a good thing to say, but that's fine. People don't care. Two more quick ones. Last week, we talked about the massive hit coming out of China. The movie called Nezah 2. Yeah. Pronunciation, I'm sure, is horrific. I actually went and tried to watch it because I was curious. The second one isn't available on streaming yet. The first one is. It's incredible. It's like an amazing movie. I loved it. And I was like, wow. Okay, I get it. China like well played. It was so like creative and interesting. Like just well made story. To come right. I can't. I can't stop. I can't stop this episode. China, they build homes. They build trains. They have great movies. They're movies. Where studio Ghibli five. I no longer want to move to Japan. Yeah, I actually really would like to watch the movie. I watched a few like Chinese animated films when I was learning Chinese during COVID for that six month period. And I really enjoyed the couple things that I watched. So. But I mean, I want to say one thing. We talked about this like we go. The movies thing. I looked at the data all the way back to 1912. America has had the number one movie every single year of human history of cinema. Until now. Until this year. 20 doesn't really count. So it wasn't really count because no, there wasn't any money in it. And we never did theaters open. But outside of that. And that's crazy. I believe Liberation Day refers to us getting back the number one spot that's a trump popped about today. I'm craft tickets. Yeah. Reviews are not. In order to topple the new Chinese movie empire, we have to go see the Minecraft movie. And that brings it. Do we have any more lightning round topics? Oh, yeah. Very last one. It's just funny. Also my Chinese acupuncturist said the second movie is not as good as the first. So sorry if anybody is kind of disappointed at the sequel. This actually actually this this falls the thesis of the last episode is that sequel. It's not. Not as good. Not as good. First one's amazing. Oh, so. So. I've become a Chinese movie snob. Yeah, I liked it before they started pumping out. You know, I was in O.D. Famous. I'm only a fan of whatever the 24 of China. And lastly, remember two episodes when I talked about the two HR companies that were beefing because they accused the other of having a spy who was stealing all our secret team deal. So are you team deal or team Ripling? Deal is again the one who hired a legitimate spy to work at Ripling and then steal the company secrets from the Slack channel. There's an update. They were accused of doing that. Ripling got the spy to confess. So he's now confessing in court and saying they tortured him. I did it. In between rounds of waterboarding. Yeah, I did it. I did it. Putin or what? It's basically saying that they reached out to him. The CEO of deal was like, Hey, I heard you're going to quit Ripling. I will pay you $6,000 a month to become a corporate spy for us. Including telling them they tried to get him and his family to bail to Dubai. And all of his lawyers, all the lawyers on deal are like using code words to be like, we know you're really stressed out with your work life right now. I might really help if you go to Dubai. And they're like, they're fucking this dude over. And they're just like, and they're doing everything. They're making him like delete all the data. All like everything was encoded. And so these they might get away with it. So this is the CEO of Ripling is currently releasing more court documents. Right now, which if you feel like looking at them there, a Parker Conrad on Twitter, it is. Let's see. Truly ridiculous. So now he's at the end. He was freaking out of what to do. And his friend told him the truth will set you free. And that's when he decided to be the better man and admit that he was a spy. So that's funny that he thought that but I read these documents and it was like he thought that after with the police showed up, he ran into a bathroom, flushed the toilet, wiped his phone. And then came outside and they said, you're going to go to jail. He's like, I'll take my chances to ran away. Yeah. So I know it's like after that, it's cool to come clean. I went to the bathroom with my phone and performed a factory reset on it. I flushed the toilet a couple times. When I came out, I just wanted to get out of there. And so seemingly this poor guy, innocent man, is now having to deal with these lawyers. He was poor because he got caught and didn't go to Dubai. Dude, it's crazy that their plan was to like send it to Dubai, though. I mean, that has all the most problems. Yeah. He went to Dubai. He's and she figured it all out. So that's where it works. And he's working out. Name one thing that isn't fixed by something. Going through the bottom, I guess you're right. You're going to actually convince me in the momentous segment. Well, I appreciated, you know, how consolidated the lightning round was. I like that one rather well. But I would like to get into you keep talked about Liberation Day. I have no idea what this means. What's it? You have to do it. It's a tariff, which I'm sure can only mean good things. As the great is pulling this up. Partially, why we haven't talked too much about this stuff because we have considered it, is that this has changed so rapidly, so often since we're going to office. He every literally every week, he's changing what is happening with tariffs. It was like, we're going to put massive tariffs. Never mind. It's going to be tit for tat. We only match other countries tariffs. Never mind. Full tariffs on these countries, like going back and forth to Canada and Mexico. And it's like been all over the place. And this announcement, correct me for a moment, was him being like, this is the day where we really set it out. This is the tariff policy. So yeah, so during the campaign last year, he said that November 20th, wherever the election day was, number fourth, that's Liberation Day. And then we got there and it came and went. And then he said Liberation Day will be January 20th, my first day in office. And that came last. Liberation. And then he said, we are since they weren't liberated yet. But today, but this is the real day. He said April 2nd, that is Liberation Day. That is the day we let out our truly sweeping tariff package across all the enemies who have been quote. I don't know if I have the quote here, but is he going to say nice things? It was like, I'm going to say this. Taking advantage, pillaging and raping us. Oh, did he use that word? Use that word directly. I'm not going to put that in his mouth. That was the direct quote. So, I didn't realize we were treating with like pirates. I didn't like, yeah, I thought we were just buying goods. I didn't realize that being the guys like in Canada, selling us like soft timber art are Vikings. Dude, so I have this reading our villages. Wow, he had this. I want to show this image that I'm bringing up here. Sorry, this is him pulling up on stage a list of all the countries who will now be receiving new reciprocal tariffs. Basically, they looked at whatever they counted as a tariff being used against us. And there's a lot of like nebulous discussion here. But he said, we're going to give you tariff back. It's usually equal to what you given us. That's the idea. And we're going to counter back. We're going to make sure the trade is fair. So, I'm based on them just having a traded man. Like, we're buying more of their stuff and they buy of us. So, it's like not fair. We need to balance it. So, you said, like, we have to worry about. I think the average American farmer is deeply worried about zvalled and Jan Mayan taking advantage of us. I think they've been, I'm sick of it. They've been pillaging us. The urban and McDonald islands have, yeah. What is that? Is that a country? This is like, what is zvalled bird and Jan Mayan? I think it's a small island. Jan, how do I know? Oh, okay. Wait, is it zvalled bird like that Norwegian island where they keep the seeds? I mean, no way is on here differently. So this is, that's confusing. This is some kind of separate agency. Is this something different? They've been pillaging. Turbulus, wait. Fucking us over. That. I'm sick of it. Yes. It's just the money for the dot tv ad. This is like, these are like Pacific island nations with like, you know, tens of thousands of people. What do we, what do we, maybe? Okay. So we need to terrify them. Norfolk islands getting a 58, no, sorry, 29% terrify. This is my, so it's extreme, right? So it's, it's across the board. I mean, this list is massive. And I want to bring something in. Well, while you're pulling that up, I just want to, so the idea is that in theory, he has matching tariffs that other countries already have on the US, right? I mean, I do my best at the risk of the military. I'm going to do my best to vocalize the argument for these tariffs to some degree. But first, I want to, yeah, the military is powerful. Again, I want to reiterate that not every single idea expressed here is what I am advocating for. But certainly that is the most common thing I've heard from people saying tariffs are good is these are reciprocal. Countries outside the US are already have these major tariffs on us in like, we have much, much lower tariffs in return. Okay. So this is that's super cool, right? That's the idea. One, one thing. Well, are they, are they reciprocal? Because you said that this is not only based on tariffs that they have placed on us. This is based on whether or not we have a trade surplus or deficit with them, which is different. It's like things that could be counted as tariffs. So it's not like them specifically having a hard tariff on us. Yeah. It's like a mix of, like let's say for example, if they have only a tariff on picking a random good, like rice or whatever. They have a tariff on one good. It's being broadly blended across a whole thing and we're doing a blanket tariff on their whole country. Or if they have a tariff, or if they have a thing where it's certain things can't ship there. What are there? Any kind of thing is being calculated as a number and it's being blended and saying, we're just going to blanket that out. And we're terrifing back all goods from that country. Yes, it's a blanket. It's this is the blanket number that applies to everything that country says. Yes, that's correct. So just to make sure I'm following this, if India, for example, tariffs American corn, which they do, yeah, there's massive tariffs on American corn and the problem there, from the farming perspective of Americans, is we can't sell corn to India, but we buy tons of stuff from India. And the idea is if they're specifically terrifying corn, we are putting in a matching that against all Indian goods. Not it's not exactly the corn number. It's like they're estimating what they think they're overall. The overall number would be based on the thing that they're doing. They're making a blanket number and they're saying, we're fighting back. That's the idea. Okay. Okay. This is on top. The similar tariffs are on top of the tariffs that he's already done. So like China, for example, already has, I don't know the exact number, 25% something like that. That's right. That's right. He's added an additional 25 to fight this reciprocal tariff. The idea. So wait, today he went added 25. Yes. Wait, doesn't that mean it's like, it's like a middle of a day? It doesn't that mean it's 45 total now? Yes, that's 54 now. 54. The tariff on China is now at the 54%. Okay, actually, I want to get a timeline here. I believe at the beginning of the year, it was 10. Right. And then he upped it to 25. Yes. So it became a 25% tariff. And then today goes to, was the big and again, I want, I feel like in the air, I feel a little liberated. I'll keep it in. I'll keep it a stack. Yeah, keep a stack. Because I think, I think something with issues like this is that oftentimes, when you talk about something like tariffs as a regular consumer, it's not super clear how it will immediately affect your day-to-day life. I am groaning right now because I run a company that manufactures clothes in China. And like often in China, and we bring them over from China to the US to sell them. That is how mogul merch makes a lot of the clothes that it makes. You actually see it's only this one, right? You're always trying to. 54% is crazy dude. This is bad for what I have to do this year. This is bad for the business that I effectively run. Can you, can you quickly explain for my audience what you're doing? Emogul, my executive don't know. So my long is. Ludwig's company, right? My longest term job with a lot of people don't know this. I literally have a day job. I work at Ludwig's company, Mogul moves. My old job was that I ran his merch company. Not only for him, it also did the merch for the yard. It used to do merch for other influencers for a time. But we mostly just focus on Ludwig's clothes now. My job has changed a little bit. I run Ludwig's whole company now, but I am still in charge of the merchandise as well. The reason that this affects this so directly is usually, if you happen to be listening to this and you happen to be someone who's bought some of our merch over the years, you might notice that it's actually pretty high quality stuff or something impressively custom made for what you'd expect from influencer merch, which is something we're very proud of. The way things like that work when you want to make a really custom jacket with specific specifications and not just a blank hoodie that you print on, which is a lot of what merchandise is, you have to make the specs of the product and then go to a factory and get that product specifically made. A lot of the industry for that type of item exists in primarily in China. China has a very, very developed and specialized manufacturing sector because of all the business they've done over the past decades. And a problem is, a lot of that type of manufacturing doesn't even exist in the US. There isn't a local option you can go to because economically, it doesn't really make sense for that type of company to exist. Like if I wanted to make that type of custom clothing in the US, I would need to go to a US factory that might be able to do that and that sort of business for those special types of jackets or hoodies or whatever we want to make don't exist in the US. So we work with factories in China, factories in Portugal, places where that is more like economically viable and that industry does exist that can make that item. So in the short term, like in response to these tariffs, right? The tariffs that already exist on China and the increase that had gone into place prior to this was already affecting our new orders of clothes going into this summer. And it's actually been tough because the drops we have coming up are also license drops with like IP. So you're balancing the fact that you have to split the costs with like the licensor that you're working with. Now the cost of manufacturing the goods is going up because of these tariffs. And then this adds a huge percent to the base cost of those goods that we're making. I'm locked into those contracts to make with those factories already. I can't back out and like make another decision now. So that's, that is why I am like, this is a very selfish reason to be exasperated. But I think probably something that other business owners in the US are feeling right now is they see this giant list and then be like, oh, this fucks the over. It's just perfect. Let me just go in as real quick. This is a perfect example. Also, yeah, I want to hear it because this is exactly what Trump wants. Exactly. But I want to explain. So Donald Trump would like you in response to that to build a factory in America or for the demand to create a factory in America. That is what he would like that you would do this. And I can, I'm not gonna cost my $10. But I want to, I want to steal man this argument. Okay, the idea is that all our manufacturing is gone to these different places. We want to bring it back. If we make it too expensive to buy from there, eventually some of the bill here is the idea that we've talked about the Jones Act and how that's the stuff can, stuff's getting in a backfiring and American consumers end up paying more for like a less quality product where they build up. But not even that. So if you are a person with a bunch of money and you're thinking, okay, well, I guess all of this factory, what you have to think about is in longer term cycles. With factory build. A couple of years. You're like, okay, if I'm gonna build this, then in four years or whatever, these tariffs better still be around. Because if they go away or they change, then I'm left with this unprofitable American factory that I spent all my money on. And then everyone's back to buying stuff from China for cheaper. So the tariffs have to be truly iron clad and rock solid and long term and built with that in mind. Now what we've seen so far is so chaotic and so scatterbrained and so up and down and so it makes it impossible for any businessman to realistically get the funding, the agreement, the board approval, to be like, all right, well, I'm gonna take the risk and I'm gonna build this in America. That's even if this would work. Now there's other many, many. I was gonna say the other part of this is even, okay, so part of the reason that the factory doesn't exist in the US at all in the first place, right? Is that if you open to that factory, the prices would be higher than the Chinese, right? You would have to be the labor cost, the cost of building the factory. We can't even hire kids. Everything, we can't even get the kids involved these days and that's all brilliant at around when we talk about the factory. I, my problem is that not only is this about like, is it kind of impossible to move forward with an idea like that, right? I, at my scale, I can't even make a decision like that. I can't be the one who opens the factory. I would rely on people with like more money and more business interests and like, opening that factory to begin with. But even if that factory opened, that the prices and costs of like running that factory mean that whatever they produce would be more expensive than what I was getting like from China or Portugal before. And the prices of what how I have to sell the custom jacket that maybe I do get to make it that factory eventually are way higher than what I would have been able to sell the jacket at. So the hoodie that maybe we get to sell for, I'll make an example in my head. A common like a nice hoodie that we recently made cost around like $80, $85. The margin to mogul moves at the end of all that was like a $20 margin ish. And if we wanted to maintain that margin, we, the price just had, would have to shift up by like whatever the value of the tariff is on that good, right? And I, and if I went to that American company that's producing it at a higher cost, then I'm just, I have to sell my consumer a more expensive, more inaccessible hoodie. They are not bending, bending benefiting from it either. Like less people will be able to buy that product if they want it. And I realized like I run a merchandise company, right? There isn't like nothing, no one's lives are like, okay, no one's like lives are at stake by being able to get the mogul moves hoodie that we made or something. But I'm just making a point of like, there isn't, it's not like this US factory gets built and then we magically get to go back to the costs and the price of the good pre tariff. It's like that industry just happens to exist in the US now. Or like that works, it just happens to be in the US. That's jobs in the US. Exactly. And then that's ignoring the point that brand said. And this is applied to every good, not just merchandise, every good from nearly every country at the exact same time. And with no prior even leak of what the numbers would be. Again, I've been watching this very closely up to this day. As of last night, the market was in panic because they don't know what is good at announced. He comes out and all of these numbers hit at once and the market was up today and then this got announced and it, I mean, just fucking plummeted. You guys are doing terrible in the stock market competition. Yeah, where we are. And you're doing fine? I'm doing okay, but I'm done. I mean, everyone's down from this. It's, this type of unreliability is one of the worst, I don't agree with tariffs in general. I think there's a long history. Yeah. Again, if you go back to the 1920s, into the great, 1930s in the Great Depression, they had the smooth, holly tarot, tariff act at the exact same time where they thought it would bring prosperity. It didn't, it also didn't last very long because people hated it so much they had to get rid of it. Which is exactly what people who are looking at this are thinking. I'm not going to make big plans on these tariffs because they're going to be so unpopular, they're going to get rolled back. Yeah. And so it is just causing only causes. It causes higher price in the short term. And this is the second thing I want to say. I don't know if you're going to mention it, but I want to show more things. Yeah, yeah. I don't know this, but Japan, China and South Korea historically are not friends. Usually they don't get along. Japan and China have so many problems. There's like huge anti-Japan sentiment in China. They're close to each other. I don't understand. And the fact that they are Cuba, I feel like. The fact that they are teaming up in response to these tariffs should be the biggest alarm bell siren. We have tariff, like if we had a strategic plan to just target China to get some manufacturing back and we got all our allies in on it and we like work together, I could see. I'm not a big tariff fan, but I could totally see it. But when you go, you try to attack everybody 500 v one, you just, it, they become friends with each other and not you. It's very isolating. I mean, I don't know how, I don't know what I want to say is like if you're out there and you hate the woke or whatever, it is not woke to dislike this. It's okay to dislike this. Like even if you're the most, I have people that I read in my feed where the most hardcore like Republican businessmen, they fucking hate this. Everybody that I can read who cares about the US economy is like against this. So I'm trying to understand that like, I don't, I don't see the benefit. I would love to have a better understanding of the benefit. If you maybe want to argue it or tell me what you've heard. Because I, it's tough to build the steel man right now because I'm having so much building. It's so, it's so, it's so, it's so, it's so, I'm gonna use this fluency American made steel to try to cut. So, so I got, I, I'm not only am I not deeply opinioned about this, I also this gets into deep economics that I am just not as familiar with as you. But I'm going to voice the thinking from Howard Luttick. Luttick. Luttick. So he's the secretary of commerce. Listen to an interview that he did on all in. And so here's the, here's the argument for tariffs. Before World War One, America had tariffs on most countries around the world. We tariffed most goods. And that was also before World War One when America was an absolutely unbelievably powerful industrial creator, right? We had massive, massive output and production as a company. That's what we were known as, so America was. And that's what basically powered and one world, I mean simplifying dramatically obviously, but World War One and especially World War Two, right? Just this massive production engine of the United States. After World War One in response to basically trying to help support countries rebuild, America stopped tariffing and said we are going to temporarily ease tariffs on these countries that are trying to rebuild because you can't afford them or trying to help you out. Then comes the Great Depression, right? Depression, like, okay, we can't put tariffs back now. I mean, historically our country has always had tariffs. We can't put it back now. But we'll wait. Then World War Two happens. Okay, that's bad. And then the Korea War happens in the 50s and then the Vietnam War happens in the 70s and it's on and on and on and all these issues where we are basically the idea is that normally you would have tariffs as most countries do to be clear. We do have less tariffs in the US than most countries, right? Like particularly like a lot of specialized goods and stuff are tariffed by a lot of countries and then when they're trying to buy from the US. And in return, we the United States have extremely low tariffs on the rest of the, like what some of the numbers on like an American-made car gets massively tariffed in Europe. And then so it's like much, they are less incentivized to buy an American-made car in Europe and we don't do the same to them. It's like a two or a four percent tariff, I think. So there is in many areas around the world this sort of like disjointed system where other countries have these tariffs in place to protect their industries and we don't. And the thinking by Howard Lutick and Trump is that by the time we got through the Vietnam War, we're in the 80s and now we've had four decades of not having destruction around the world, not having countries that are ravaged by war at least to the same extent. That we as America need to go back to what we used to do which is to say, hey, we're going to protect our industries. And over the last four decades, we've seen that basically all manufacturing in the US has been off-shored that these manufacturing jobs are gone that exactly like you said, all like you and me, I make, I'm a mug salesman technically. Yes, sir. Right, we, like we make our mugs in China because there's barely the option to do that in the US. Yeah, I think that's the thing. Even if you want to, the options to choose from are very limited in terms of what you can actually make. Yes, yes. And so, so the idea is basically this is how you protect your own industries. On top of that, it incentivizes companies to come build. So right now, if you have a company, if you are building a new factory, you are incentivized for merch, let's say, you're incentivized to go build that in Mexico or China because the costs are going to be so much lower and margins are going to be higher. But if across many different industries, all these different companies say, you know, not necessarily you, Aiden, but the person who is deciding to build the next factory goes, you know what, it's going to cost about the same. Let's do this in America. It brings jobs back here that are high quality and high paying. Like you said, costs will go up. But the idea is that those costs are going up to fund Americans getting jobs in America and that over time, then as even though costs are higher, wages also rise at a higher level, right? Because the quality of our incomes is going up rather than everything being off-shore to the cheapest possible bidder. This is the argument. Also, there would be potentially a large amount of income generated from tariffs, even though it's mostly paid by the consumer. That is Howard Lettics argument that is Trump's thought. We used to have this system for the first half of American history, the second half we do not have tariffs. And that has basically caused all of our manufacturing to dissipate and other countries are taking advantage of us by terrifying our stuff and making it even harder for people to build in the United States. Because if they then can't sell to other countries, because they're being tariff, they may as well go build in other countries. They true. Yeah, okay. There's a lot to impact there. What I want to say is I think the timeline was a little bit skewed on that. In that, these tariffs were gone before we're worth it. Okay. You talked about how manufacturing help us. You said they really started drop. I believe late 1800s and really at the start of World War I and the end of World War I. That's when the United States government said, hey, let's ease up on everybody else to help them right now. And they have had that attitude since. Right. And our manufacturing peak is after World War II. So the tariffs were gone before World War II. Interesting. We have a manufacturing boom during the end of a great depression into World War II. And our peak is right after we, when everyone else is dead and not dead. Actually, it's over dead. Yeah, a lot of people. Europe's blown up and we're building. World War II people. What I would say is that our manufacturing peak is when we are the leader in making the best stuff. When we are competitive. When you add up all these broad blocks and tariffs, what you're really doing is you're taxing your own citizens to provide a jobs program for this specific industry. Right. And you're doing it briefly because it's only as long as people will stomach these tariffs. Which means it's very risky for someone to make that investment choice. Because they know it's so, people don't like paying more for shit. Yeah. It's a hidden tax. So usually they'll get raw, like this Mood Holly tariffs, which is the last tariffs we had in America. They were so deeply unpopular. They extended the Great Depression. They made everything more expensive. They got rolled back. Wait, what were those? They're called the Smooth Holly tariff and it was in the 1934. And at the beginning of the Great Depression, they were like, all right, we're going to solve this problem that everything's getting bad. We're going to do a bunch of tariffs and it's going to protect all our industry and keep our jobs. It did the opposite effect. They extended it and made it worse. People couldn't afford anything. The people started laying people off. The Depression got worse and extended. So after about three, four years, they abandoned the tariff act that got scrapped. And that's when we actually began this whole resurgence boom into World War II. That's part of that is government spending on World War II. But so the idea that the only way we can be competitive is if we block our competition is to me scary. It says that we have given up the fact that we could even be competitive. And what happened instead, now this is a problem for hauling out the middle class. We have to figure this out. But like, it's not like America stopped making everything is that we moved up the value chain. We started to making high-tech stuff. We made Boeing planes. We made high engineering stuff. We stopped making toasters. We stopped making t-shirts. We stopped making those things got exported to different countries. Because I don't think one country can make everything in the world. I think you want to be at the high end of the value chain. You want to make the best and high-sense stuff. And generally the most profitable countries in the world. I'm thinking of like, why am I always, what is hauling? We have touch. Netherlands. Yeah. The Netherlands, they have ASML. They make the most high-end lithography machines a big part of their economy. They're not making t-shirts and toasters there. They have a growing economy. They make the highest end stuff. Usually the wealthier countries move up that chain. So the idea that we're going to hurt all our trade partners, we're going to tax our own citizens. So we can bring back the toaster jobs and the t-shirt jobs at the expense. That scares me. And again, I think alliances matter. I think trade partners matter. Also, we have, well, it's, before this, had relatively low tariffs. But we didn't have the lowest tariffs. And the countries at the highest part of, I mean, we had a chart of like lowest tariffs, the highest tariffs. The ones with the highest are like the countries that have terrible economies. It's like Bangladesh. It's like, they're at the bottom of the ladder and they're trying to protect their small little industries as best they can, but they're not competitive in anything. So for me, this feels similar to the Jones Act. We're like, it's a misguided attempt to protect American shipbuilding. The end up with Americans paying more for shipping. We're not, and you're not even getting good ships. Like, what's not going to work? It's, I don't think it works. That's why I am anti-terriff most generally. And especially a non-targeted here. A blanket one just feels like we're trying to get everything everywhere all at once. To be built in America while pissing off everybody and having no friends that want to make, that's why I'm against. I'm just, that's my counter to Howard Lunding, because basically briefly, but I could see some targeted, you know, I could, I'm not inflexible, but that's, that's my, do you feel like this? So I think probably some of the biggest motivation for this is the sense that the middle class is disappearing in the United States. Yes. And that is because middle class jobs are disappearing. And many of those jobs have been outshored. And I think there's been what I would call a fantasy that we as Americans are smarter than everybody else. And we are the ones who should be managing products and being creative, like Apple does. And then the Chinese and the Indian, those people should make the phones. Not us, right? But we'll keep designing the phones. And I think there's so much evidence that we are not going to be the dominant player in this forever. China is making arguably better electric cars than us right now. They, you know, Asia has better public transit right now. China is testing out flying taxis right now. And that is also happening in the US actually. And it's very exciting. But at a much slower pace, that's being more, that's more expensive and is going through more regulations and all this stuff. So they're going to beat us on that most likely. And my concern is the, you know, we've potentially lost the middle class because so many different industries in the US have been lost to other parts of the country. And that idea of like, well, that works. We specialize in one thing. I don't know how much we specialize. Like it can are specializations in the US. Bond an entire middle class. I don't know. I actually actually think this is really interesting because this segway is I think pretty cleanly into what is the back half of the book we've been reading. So dogs suggested we read this new book called Abundance by Edges Recon, which I think we might talk about more in depth like on the book on the whole. Like what we like about it criticism is in general. And it also is heavily tied to Doug's topic in this episode. But the back half of the book is about innovation and invention and about how basically what the US specifically needs to do in order to maintain and grow into that status of being a high end manufacturing economy that you're talking about. Like these richer nations slowly transition into being a place where new innovative ideas can thrive and be built. And that's, and that is what holds up their economy. And a lot of the book is discussing the points at which new scientific breakthroughs are being held back or new inventions and the things that funded inventive and innovative ideas 50 to 100 years ago in America are not really there. The systems within the US hold back that opportunity that we would ideally transition into. And I think that compounds with other things in the US like something like cost of education, whether or not you want to go to university or a technical school or a trade school, the cost of school in general is going up in the US so that holds people back from being able to transition into roles like that that might be able to build up a new metal class in this country that can't exist with like the old systems of the past, like mainly manufacturing that we're talking about right now. I think that's an interesting thing to think about. No, I agree. I mean, there's, you know, it's a multifaceted problem. Yeah. I do. And we will solve it by every episode. Every episode is all the problems here on limited stand. I guess I am just, um, this feels first of all, I think we would all agree, like more of a chainsaw than a scalpel. Like it feels more of like a, a heavy duty. I actually think that your first point that you brought up presides over everything is because even if, even if you, can you say his name one more time, who is how would love it? Howard Lutting. Even if you agreed with everything that guy said through the bath of Doug on in the villain chair, right. If you agreed with everything in that perspective, it is overridden by what H. trioxet at the beginning, which is the execution of these tariffs has been so inconsistent and changes so much day to day. Also, the inherent nature of our, of our political system, right, which is unpinitivably gone. People at most be probably, yeah, that's a term. Be out of, be out of office in another four years. Your ability to make some sort of long-term investment decision in the country to, in, in association with these tariffs is really, really difficult. And I feel like that whole argument crumbles because of that. Like, you have no promise of like, well, if I'm going to invest $50 million into factory and logistics and supply chain in the United States, that's not going to be worth it five years from now. Why would I take that risk? And it kind of, the whole argument to me crumbles at just the basis of that. But ignoring everything else you had to say. We do not have a Xi Jinping who will be in power till he dies. Everything's going to change in two and four years. And then six years, it's like, yeah, over the next 10 episodes of this podcast, watching Doug become more progis. I'm, I mean, I mean, this is, I actually think this is a, the, maybe a long discussion. This, this is a tough topic to talk about because I think it sets off like some, you know, it's funny because I think it actually is upsetting to both, like people across the political spectrum is the idea of an authoritarian figure being able to create more positive change in shorter periods of time than you can in a democracy. I think like a good example of this is like Lee Kuan Yu in Singapore. I was just going to say it's good to say Singapore. Everyone's in Singapore. I got to Lee Kuan Yu in Singapore first. Everyone's in Singapore. And it's not like there are no, it's, I'm not here to be like, oh, Lee Kuan Yu has nothing to be criticized for. There are no downsides to Singapore's political system. But that's no problem. But the idea that I think people point to that often is that, oh, Singapore is, is this country that was created kind of from nothing, is it, and it is an extremely successful place to be? And the way, how did my friend describe it? I had a friend who was talking to me about how, you know, and this comes with the, the absurge who have like Hong Kong has like so many problems too, like, like cost of living, for instance. But he was talking about how Hong Kong is kind of the old, is like the old wave place of business in Asia. It's like Hong Kong is starting to like phase out a little bit. And Singapore is like the now place to be for business in Asia. And I think across the board, there's a lot of things in Singapore that you could talk about are really good. Like the way their like healthcare system works. The like social government, like provided housing that they have. Yeah, just give context. All right. So Singapore has a authoritarian, had out of the three, I mean, there is, but that authoritarian leader named Lee Kuan Yu, who was like considered to be a brilliant statesman. He's like what you call, you know, a benevolent authoritarian leader who made like a lot of hard choices to get the system systems, rope and running. They make the trains run on time, make the place clean, get rid of crime, etc, etc. And it worked. And the question becomes, is it worth having a benevolent authoritarian leader in the short term with a government that could then be ruined by, you know, it's like, there's good in person, Roman, there's bad in person. It's like, that's the problem is with an emperor. And when I, when I bring up, I think it's so interesting, because I had a kind of debate with my chat recently about this. We're talking about France. I'm not going to get into it. But like, I think a lot of young people around the world, and this is showing out in the polls, are getting a little fed up with democracy. I saw a poll in France that was like 48% of young people are like, they would agree with the statement that democracy doesn't get enough done. Like they feel like things are getting frozen. And first of all, that should be scary to anyone like, who values democracy like the idea that the idea that democracy is failing. Is a scary one, right? Because the costs, I think gridlocked. I think instilled, I mean, at least in the way like I was brought up, and everything in our education system and everything in our media is a very anti like authoritarian indicator, not for bad reasons. I don't know if you guys know this. Historically, a lot of that guys at the helm of a few places. And I think that's the problem. Oh yeah, name one. Like the cost of like that type of leadership style is so great. And there's like all these little pros and cons. I hate to be the guy, but there's new wants with every. We did a button. We did a new one. We could hit for every argument where it goes. Okay, but then we also need a button that says there's no new wants. And that way when we solve the problem at the end, we can press that button. New wants is now so excited. We're solving the world's problems. And the same goes for China, right? It's like they have a political system that allows them to plow forward and make and develop things that, you know, the easiest example that is also in that book. But I think a lot of people know already is China has an incredible network of high speed. I do. I mean, you say trains. But that's one example, right? Even even housing in China to a, I would say to a bad degree, because it kind of came around the other side where you could argue they built too much. Yeah, overbrew. Yeah, real estate in China kind of started to fall. Is kind of crumbling. In the process of, yeah. Yeah. But in California, we can't even get through this like one high speed rail project and it's taken literally decades. And this I'm feeling quickly. Quick, coming off. Quick, check ways into Doug's topic, which is why building in the, in the US, I think this applies broadly to many places, but especially in the US and especially in democratic states and cities, how we cannot build things anymore, primarily housing and infrastructure projects and things like that. Doug, how do we solve building in America without Asian pink? How do I would like to hear the solution? Doug's solution, he's like, he's like cryo chamber Lee Kuan Yu. Clown. I've stolen some of his hair on a trip to China. We are going to clone. Is this it? Right here. Fashion. That's that's. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the ring. It is the ring. No, no, no. I control the power. I control it. I'm the one who can carry the villain chair to, uh, I can chose that chair by the way. Do you know the amount of cancellation? Until I throw myself into the fire. No, I actually did pick the villain chair today because I am literally going to complain about a bunch of, uh, states that we like often. I do really before we start. I'm actually quite curious about this because you are quite literally like the exact type of business owner and runner, Adan. Yeah. That Trump is trying to target with these tariffs. And so what you just said about like the cost of the Chinese manufacturing is going to go 50%, which is insane, right? Out. So will you at least right now, do you think you will start exploring factories in the United States for like obviously you're right now. You're locked into contracts, but let's say in a year if this continues. Now, I mean, we'll have new stuff. Okay. So, uh, the short answer is no. Go. Okay. Because we already, for products that we can make in the US, we already do. Like that, that I don't know how broadly this applies to like other industries. But the way it works for us is we're not locked into exclusivity contracts with any of the people we work with. So when we have different types of products, we make them with different people depending on the needs. So the reason we go to China to make those like a good example that a lot of people know is we made this chest boxing hoodie. And they had these like corduroy patches on the elbows. It had these custom strings with like chest pieces on it. And the hoodie string was metal. That is not something we could make in the US. But it is a different example. We released a sweater earlier this year that was like a parody. It just was a parody of spam and it just said scam instead of spam. We made that in the US. We work with like a local company in Southern California to make that one. And that's because the type of product, that type of manufacturing exists in the US. And we can do it with them. And it has a lot of conveniences. It's like come like not just like price and but also like availability. How quickly we get samples. Ease of like working with those partners. All of those things are really, really good. So for the product, it's like I'm already making choices like that where I can. And I think that's part of the frustration is I don't know how that works for other businesses. But I know that for instance, a lot of people buy in raw materials, right? They probably don't have an option to buy a lot of those raw materials in the US. I'm not buying raw materials. The human of mine is only in one, you know, you can't. Exactly. Yeah, it's yeah. So continue. Oh, oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, that's why yeah, if you want to jump into. No, I was just curious. Like, so we have a great example here of like would you are you? Thinking and seriously considering changing your business practices as a result of tariffs? Because that is what he is trying to do. He is trying to convince people like you to start going and trying to support American companies. And then it's by you doing that incentivize the person who's considering making a factory and doing it here, right? And that's that's their big push. And that's what they're arguing is working. You know, you have companies like TSMC who makes chips, right? Who makes the chips that we use for literally everything, not Doritos, but microchips. Like, to end to end that part of the discussion. Then I think the it entirely comes down to availability of what we can make and price. It's not really, I'm not here with this merge business to try and support the Chinese or the Portuguese economy. I wasn't picking it based on that. It's based off of we had a vision of types of products we wanted to make because it was important for us to make unique high quality products for this merchandise company. And if an American company can make that at a price point that we're happy with, yeah, I would switch. Did he pay us for this like 30 minute merch ad for my money? That's true. You're going through each individual product talking about how great those. Those are even more sale anymore. Like if you are interested in what he's doing, go to dug dug dot shop and check it out. But yeah, let's get into the Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm curious of just your reaction because like theory that anyway. So well, maybe we get updates on on China. Absolutely. How many things you're exploring in the US and maybe how that plays out? Yeah. Cool. Okay. So what what I want to talk about is a subject that was really elaborated on in a book called Abundance. This came out what two weeks ago, maybe something like that. Yeah, it was recently seen. By Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, Ezra Klein is a very popular left leaning podcaster, journalist, all that. So very influential in left discussion. And this book, I would say the thesis of it came out and said, the left side of the political spectrum has become too focused on process and not results when it comes to governing. He's supposed I would say the way I've been describing it to people is the he's specifically critical of basically the democratic establishment within the US. Yes. He is he's over the past 50 years, how the Democrats in the US and the popular version of the American left, like whatever that has been behind the Democrats has gotten bogged down in in process. Yes. Yeah. And then I am very passionate about this because I have watched San Francisco, which is a city I lived in or near for like six years and grew up near. Deteriorate is a very strong word. That's a little too hyperbolic. I think it has immensely suffered over the past couple decades as a result of these policies. And this is the most liberal city in the country, arguably, but it's certainly one of the most liberal liberal in the most liberal state, probably certainly one of the most impactful liberal states with the largest budget in so many different areas. There's golden goose of the tech industry and they have almost every respect completely failed their constituents through very these policies. So anyways, this book I think is fascinating. A specific thing I want to focus on, people are leaving democratic cities. So Manhattan, Brooklyn, Chicago, Los Angeles, R&Pays to lose 50% of their under five childhood population in the next 20 years. 50% of like families basically are leaving these cities. Right now in 2023, California had a net loss population of 280,000 people. That's not 280,000 people who left California. That means on net that many more people left than came in. That is, California has grown basically forever. Since it's, it was created. This is a new thing. The idea that California would shrink New York state. The entire state had a loss of 179,000 illinois, which has Chicago. People are leaving that state and they're leaving because prices are too much. That is consistently what I say. It is too expensive to live here. It's too expensive to raise families here. Child cares too much. Everything is too expensive. And the quote that he says pretty early in the book, which is why I get so frustrated by this is you are not the party of working families. When the places you govern are places working families cannot afford to live. Yeah. And this is what I've gotten so just upset about over the years. And not only that, even if you don't care about, I don't know, impoverished people and you only care about winning elections. Right now because of the populations shifts, New York, Rhode Island, Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, California, very left-leaning states are on track to lose seats in the House of Congress, right? To lose electoral votes. So, and then Florida, Texas, Idaho, Utah, very red states are gaining them. And so if this trend continues, it also would make it much, much, much harder for a future democratic candidate to win the presidency. Because usually it's all based on these swing states, but that's not going to matter if some of the most powerful blue states just don't have as much representation because there's less people. And so the biggest thing is this comes down to the fact that in Democrat led cities in America, there is an enormous amount of processing and permitting and legal process that prevents things from being built. The most obvious is housing. So in 2023, SF San Francisco issued about 7,500 new housing permits. San Francisco is a city of about a million. 7,500 new housing permits. Boston, all of Boston, Metro, had 10,500 New York City, Newark, and New Jersey City together, a little less than 40,000, and then Houston in Texas, which is a dog shit place. No offense anybody lives there. issued almost 70,000 home pack watch on Houston. That is 10 times the amount of San Francisco that's how many new homes are being built. And then guess what, Shocker, who Houston has the lowest homelessness rate of any U.S. major city? Yeah. This is, I mean, they dug into this, dug into this a lot in the book, was how, and this sites another book that I've heard from multiple people is very good that I, I want to read for myself, which is called housing is a homeless, sorry, homelessness is a housing crisis. Yes. And it basically goes over how anything that is a suspected indicator of homelessness, stuff like poverty or drug use are these predictors of homelessness or or mental illness and walks through point by point how all of these things actually don't correlate with homelessness at all. And that homelessness is solely correlated with housing prices and availability and affordability of homes. Yes. And I think it's funny because yeah, using a place like, you know, you could use a place like Houston as an example in a red state in a red city. I don't know if they have a democratic governor or sorry mayor or not. I don't know Houston. But that, you know, California has more like social welfare than Texas does. But there are way more homeless people in California or sorry, yeah, in California. And that this basis of like housing availability is the major factor at play of whether or not people wind up in the streets or not. And there are other factors that are like tied into it that make it more difficult to say like get off the street once you're there, right? It's not that these other things are not factors involved in some capacity. But people need to be in houses first and you need to enforce policy that makes housing available to all people as much as possible. I like the analogy that was used in the book a lot, which is that housing is like a game of musical chairs. And it's like there might be people who are poorer or suffering from mental illness or drug addiction. But if they're if everybody has a chair in the room, they can, you know, they get a seat. Everybody when the music stuff is sitting a seat. But when you start removing seats, it's the person who is suffering from drug addiction that's most likely to fall through the cracks first. And housing is like the, I mean, this is kind of where the housing is a human right crowd is so right in my opinion. It's like, and the way I think this is a big thing of how Finland basically solved homelessness in the country, which is, you know, very different scale of country. I understand that. But Finland got rid of homelessness because they just gave people, they just made sure everybody has a home. And that's and that is the way they handled it, right? Which is, and I think at the root of like making housing widely available is, is that like making sure that people can build as much of it as possible. Yeah, you plan to clip? Yeah. Okay. Just just some of stats I thought looking into this of just San Francisco versus Houston is really interesting. San Francisco has about a million residents. Houston has over two million. So Houston has twice as many people by at least, right? Houston, Houston spends $70 million a year approximately. And that's like an increase from previous years on combating homelessness. Again, this is the city that has the lowest homelessness rate of any major U.S. city. That's 70 million a year. San Francisco spends $850 million a year on homelessness. It is an astronomical amount. You could buy entire homes for people almost with that amount. What if they got it wrong and they're spending the money on more homelessness? Oh, right. They're buying. I mean, on ironically, that's what's happening. If you spend, so we're going to get into this in all this process. It's, we'll give you money. Yeah. And like it's this fucking tragedy, man. So again, like Houston lowest homelessness rate of any major U.S. city, they estimate it costs 17 to 19 K to house a homeless resident in Houston. In San Francisco, the estimated cost is 40 to 47. So it's just over twice as much. Uh, and Houston, the median home costs a bit over $300,000. In San Francisco, it's 1.7 million. So it's like, yeah, no shit. If you make home absolutely obscenely expensive, you make housing expensive people are going to fall through the cracks and it doesn't matter if you pour almost a billion dollars into homelessness and you have like a thousand NGOs and nonprofits giving people support, which I've personally seen in San Francisco. It doesn't matter if you don't provide housing. And so then you probably wonder, why aren't we building housing? You know, housing specifically is like its own kind of rabbit hole about all the policies in place that which we've touched on a little bit that incentivize people to not allow housing so that their home prices go up. But I want to highlight some of the sort of stories and instances from this book or the Ezra Klein has been talking about that I think are particularly illuminating and frustrating about how Democrat led governance isn't doing anything. It's not building anything. So number one, this is a, this is a video about Ezra Klein talking, oh, this is actually just broadly about not being built. If I pull up the one with John Stewart, he did a, that's somewhere around here. Oh, okay, Elon posted it for some reason. So he talks to John Stewart, we don't need the audio here because it's a long clip. You might have heard about the build back better program Joe Biden. Yeah, let's spend like a trillion dollars or better infrastructure and supporting this city. And this sounds great, right? And the Republicans were saying, no, we shouldn't spend more money. We're way the fucking debt. And Democrats are saying, no, this is critically important to helping reduce inequality and helping rebuild the middle class. We should build stuff. We should build infrastructure. This sounds great, right? Who would be against that? I mean, you know, unless you don't think government should be spending money, but like obviously building a lot of stuff, that sounds great. One of the things that they started four years ago was rural broadband. And the idea is that the government is going to fund all of this rural internet to be sent out and expanded to rural areas around the United States. Which is a great idea because oftentimes with something like the internet, which is basically, basically a utility now, there isn't a profit incentive for a private company to build it on their own out to areas like that because it just simply won't have a history of it to be profitable, right? We did it for electricity. Yeah. And the, and stuff like the postal service, like these are the type of things that the government is really good at providing and should provide because without the government providing it, the market market, the market would never do it. And this is a way to help people in rural areas, you know, help get away from that massive income gap, right? You give them these resources. So great idea, right? Sounds great. It has been four years. No, rural broadband has been built. Apple, none. There have been, there's surely like a 14-step review. I don't even have high speed internet in downtown Los Angeles. Yeah. Yeah. Not only, I mean, it's one thing to be like, oh, I don't even have rural broadband right now. If you don't in your city, that's great. And that's frustrating. Well, it's not great. It's frustrating in its selfs, right? But this is the government proudly saying we've allocated a trillion dollars with like, I forget exact number 45 billion, I believe for rural broadband specifically. That is an astronomical amount of money that could build thousands of homes in China. That could do so much. And after four years, nothing has been built at all. And in this clip, which is from the weekly show, a John Stewart podcast, if you are interested in hearing more, John Stewart is absolutely like taken aback as Ezra Describes the 14 steps that cities or states had to go through in order to try to bid to get the money from the government to do all this stuff. Because it's not just, hey, we want to do this thing and the government says, yes, no, there's a process where you have to, you have to give potential evaluations, then buyer mental reviews and then challenges where anybody who might be affected by this in any way, shape, perform can challenge it. And then you have to do this at a national level and then a state level. And there's all these steps that are incredibly cumbersome. And each one of them, as is repeatedly said in the book, very well intentioned, right? Of course, it's great. Like we want people, you know, we want minorities to not be adversely affected by building in these areas. But when you add step after step after step after step, this goes on for years. Nothing has been built. That's one example, high speed rail in California. They have built zero miles of functioning track in California. So just to be clear, this has been going on for over a decade. There's been billions of dollars spent in California. We have built zero lines of functioning track zero. It just can't be done. No other country is done. No, country must be the best about not doing it. By comparison, Florida, as bright, bright line has built high speed rail. It is functioning right now because Florida allowed them to build stuff. But when you look through the amount of environmental reviews, lawsuits, processes, every single part of every single piece of land, everybody who could possibly be affected by this got to have their say and put up legal challenges, put up all these different things to stop this. So it is taken one of the former CEO of the high speed rail said that he's flabbergasted that for some of these things have over a decade, they've been going through the process to get a small chunk of the land approved for building. This is, I want to say insanity, but I think for our generation, it doesn't sound that crazy because we're not used to anything being built. Well, I think it, yeah, I think that's part of it is like the expectations for the speed of these things has definitely shifted, right? The idea that these can happen, things can happen in like short periods of time is pretty, it's, you don't expect things to. I think it cites a story about how after there was like a devastating fire under one of the big highways in Pennsylvania, the governor, like basically emergency powers to push through a bunch of the rebuild of the highway that would typically be expected to take like a few years and didn't it take like 14 days or yeah, yeah, I just want to read. I want to read about this. And I think, okay, you just want to restate that for somebody. The estimation based on American building standards, when a major bridge broke down due to a car collision and a fire, was that it would take multiple years to get it rebuilt. This is a critical part of infrastructure in that area. And Josh Shapiro, the governor said we're going to invoke emergency powers to not allow the massive amounts of regulation and environmental review and lawsuits and all these parties involved. We are going to just instead of having to bid to a hundred different contractors and everybody gets to do a process and there has to be all this notice for all this stuff, right? They just acted and they got it done in two weeks. And again, I want to two weeks is what is possible if people aren't constrained by these massive amounts of regulation and processes versus two years. And it's not that it like you said, we can build instead. We're able to build. They don't have good intentions behind them. Like the very well time building the context behind like why a lot of these regulations exist at all. It spends a lot of time explaining like the build up of like the modern environmental movement and how like a lot of places within the US, we're getting basically soiled by the costs of manufacturing and the way we treated water and the way we treated the land, right? And there was used to be a lot more pollution in the country. And then we enacted environmental policy that helped push back against that. And I think it's important that the book to say that the book acknowledges that and isn't writing that off and saying that there isn't value in what those things produce. I think it's more just saying there's a needle to be thread in that it's gone very far the other way where these regulations have inhibited the ability for us to solve problems in the country. A very basic things that are very, very good things for your population to have access to. So this is the main point I want to make and it's the reason why I'm very passionate about this and very frustrated and why Frank, I'm just I'm just repulsed by the politicians who do this and the people who advocate for these things. It's fine to, in good, to advocate for health environment and to be concerned about conservation and helping air quality and helping make sure that disadvantaged communities are served and that we can support minority on businesses. These are great things. But when you add so many of these processes and so many of these restrictions and so many goals that you're trying to do on every project, then nothing happens and everybody suffers much more than you built and everybody is mad. It's not worth jumping into it. There's this video by reason TV called the insane battle to sabotage a new apartment building in San Francisco, which is just encapsulates in the most infuriating, unbelievable way. This is the one that's built on like Nordstrom parking lot or whatever. No, that's there's plenty like this. This is a guy who wanted to turn his laundromat in the mission into a big apartment structure and create lots of housing. And how every single part of the city basically did everything they could to stop this. He spent like four million dollars going through litigation before anything got built because, oh, there's shade on a on a playground for an hour a day that already has a lot of shade on it by the way. And in the mission, you're going to gentrify this area even though there's affordable housing in the project. And this might the neighbors, I mean, it just goes on and on. It is truly unbelievable to watch this and go San Francisco. He's the most one of the most progressive cities in the country who are constantly espousing how much they care about the working class of minorities have done everything they can to a truly baffling degree to stop anything for being built. This is, well, I think the common pushback here and we actually got a little bit in the comments of the last episode kind of around this topic because we talked about how much Tokyo built. And how much Japan built in general in order to keep their housing relatively affordable. At least post post real estate. And the, I think the common like counter arguments here is like, what I'll try to put out there is the first thing I saw, and this is brought up in the book as well, is people advocate for socialized housing, which is or like government provided housing. And I actually think there's a strong like merit to that argument. But what Ezra says in the book is like, that's all fine. It basically fine and dandy. That would be good. But the regulations that affect the ability to build in the first place apply in either scenario, whether you want the market and like private companies to provide the housing or you want the government to build the housing, they're dealing with the same hurdles that you need to change either way. And I mean, examples for that is like, you know, there are cities like Vienna, for example, that have huge, like a huge percentage of the housing in the city is publicly owned, like operated by the government. And that's a part of what keeps like housing affordable and rents controlled. And then private housing in the city is forced to compete against that. So it helps like regulate the market, right? But it doesn't matter. It's like, you can't even get to that part of the argument with the initial, with the initial blockers of building their first place. Yeah, one of the examples he had was like, there was money for public housing. I believe in LA for like affordable built housing. And they had, I don't know, 80 to 100 million. And they flash forward a few years, half of it is built, not as the right place, not even built. And it cost, I think 700,000 per unit. And these are really small for houses. They could have bought a full size house in, it's almost a full housing product. It was way too expensive and slow. So even though they had the plan to build some kind of socializing, it was over budget, over time, and too expensive per unit to even be justifiable. So here's what I would say, right? If you're a response to this is this is why we need socialized housing, that is not solving the problem because the problem is the government can't build anything. Right? Even if there's two, you know, thoughts here, one, you could like really expand the free market, make it way easier for private developers to build. And I think there's a lot of evidence that that works. Could I give the next argument that sort of plays into that as well? Sure. Yeah. Yeah, I think I think you're right about that. The other thing that I think people bring up a lot, and I think well, well, meaning people is there like, well, why does the building, like, why does the housing project or why does the building that's going to happen? Why does it have to be these, like, luxury style condos and like expensive places to live? Why can't they be more affordable? And I think there's two strong arguments against that, which is one, the building needs to happen no matter what. If you allow enough projects, like, if you okay enough projects, regardless of like their scale or like who they're meant to be offered or afforded by, if you build enough, that does like regulate the market over time. Like you want people to just build in the first place to like get regulations out of the way of building in the first place for that to exist. But two, a lot of the reason why luxury housing is the only type of thing that can go up is the current regulations force upon like units, like each unit needs to have a certain amount of like parking spaces allotted with it or needs to be built in a certain way. Things that expand the cost of the development. So they're forced to price at luxury prices or high end prices. So the only buildings that are getting okay, are those luxury condos because that's the only thing that's economically viable to pursue. And that comes with stuff like the parking spaces as an example, the parking requirements. With the guy in San Francisco, it's okay, if you have to spend four to five million dollars, which by the way could build a building, if you need to spend that much just to get the approval to build a thing, the only people who can afford to go through all that process and still build something at the end are big luxury apartments. So the very people, the very progressives who are stopping all this and saying, no, you can't do this. It's not affordable enough. By putting all these processes in place are preventing anything from being built in everybody's suffers. And I mean, I this will go to like my the overall thing that I was really taking away from the book, which represents the frustration I have felt watching politics in San Francisco with friends of mine, which is that there's this. He talks, he says everything bagel approach in the book. So the idea with like you're trying to make everybody happy and get everybody on board. So if you build in most democratic states, it's not just the landowner that you're needing to purchase the land from and the immediate landowners nearby. It's also every possible preference of the neighbors and the community and the character of the neighborhood and the homeowners associations and how it looks in every possible environmental angle. And we have all these lawsuits like Seaka where you don't even have to really be related. You can just throw up lawsuits towards basically any single project. This is used to extort people into building with certain contractors, by the way, because they will be like, hey, we have environmental concerns about your hospital you're building in Sacramento. But if you go with us as contractors for all of the work, we're not really concerned anymore. These are easily abused. So you need to get the preferences of the unions and certain minorities and disadvantaged groups and small businesses and the tax players and lenders and auditors. And if you try to make every single person or every possible shareholder super happy with everything, which is how our government at least in blue states is is running as operating. Then nothing happens. And like if you refuse to build anything because nobody gets fully satisfied by it, everybody is worse off. And you're seeing this happen year over year as San Francisco becomes more expensive and homelessness becomes worse. And I 10 years ago and I lived there and maybe you had the same experience 10 years ago, no working class person that I met in San Francisco lived in the city because they could not afford it. And instead they lived in other parts of the Bay area and had to take Bart the subway. Yeah, I lived in Berkeley and I commuted every day because you can't afford to live there. And so these like God, one of the quotes it from the book is in much of San Francisco, you can't walk 20 feet without seeing a multi colored sign declaring that Black Lives Matter kindness is everything and no human being is illegal. These signs sits in yards zoned for single families and communities that organize against efforts to add new homes that would bring those values closer to reality. San Francisco's Black population has fallen in every census counts since 1970. Poor families disproportionately non-white and immigrant are pushed into long commutes over crowded housing and street homelessness. Every year, their policies in San Francisco and these incredibly progressive cities are making everybody suffer particularly the groups that they supposedly care about. And that's why I get so frustrated is because it's one thing if you're an asshole and you say fuck all y'all we have our homes. We're going to not allow building because our values go up, right? That's what Robert Wright does. This professor at Berkeley who constantly shuts down housing projects because he says there's not enough affordable housing. And then coincidentally, his housing that he owns in multiple parts of the Bay Area goes up in value. Do it's fine. If you want to be a selfish prick, that's fine. But own it. I don't think it's fine. I don't think it's fine. But fucking own it, man, like well, this is what bothers me. Like to have such vehement culture of the of the of the democratic governance in our country. That is all about how virtuous we are and how we care about these disadvantaged groups and we care about homelessness or we're in attacks. Everybody can also homeless us. And then you don't do anything about it. And objectively, your policies year after year fail the people around you. It unbaffles me that somebody like Aaron Peskin in San Francisco could be on the board of supervisors for like two decades. Every single year his policies have made it less affordable. Homelessness has gotten worse. All of these metrics get worse. And then he turns around and says it's the Republicans fault in San Francisco. And I I've just personally seen this and seen so much of that city struggle because of these policies. And and if well, there's a I think there's a there's a good part. Another good part of the book. That talks about how in, you know, we talked about this in the last episode. This basic concept of, you know, Nimbism. You're you're you advocate for things like vocally and on paper, you want things to like be a certain way, but it would come down to like approving like new housing or voting against the interest of like the private property you already own in the area. People end up saying no. They vote in like their own economic interests. And in the book, they bring up the example of someone talking about these like, you know, town hall or like local meetings where like these types of votes occur or where these types of votes get discussed. And how the reason of like protecting your homes value never comes that it is a serial faux pas ever addressing or talk about any capacity. But people talk about changing the character of the neighborhood. I got a few comments. I got a few comments on the last episode about how it's primarily about crime. And I and I want to I don't want to know what incentivizes crime if people can't afford houses. So I go right off that comment immediately, right? Because I do think there is I think there are some it's I don't want to like look at somebody who's complaining about crime and then just like write off every concern that they have. I think the problem with that is oftentimes those claims are like not based in reality. If you look at statistics around crime around like how I think you can like map out like people's concern with crime like increasing over time over the last few decades, but crime going down the entire time like a lot of like fear about crime has to do with its presentation through like news and media and yeah, statistical likelihood. But beyond that, the crime that does exist that people are often talking about is rooted in the cost of living and the the people's in access to like homes and in security. Like that is what a crime is like connected and rooted in. And if you allow people to build enough over time, then you start to solve that problem as well. Like that is also at the root of that problem. It even if you are genuinely a good actor who is like, we're worried about that, I guess it would be my would be my argument to that is like you cannot say no to housing and complain about crime and then also want that in basically in good faith to like go away. What crime actually does exist. If that makes sense. I mean, I agree with all this. I guess I just want to say that I so I want to talk about deregulation in response to this, but first, yeah, okay, I just want to say I think it's easy in a lot of issues to blame the people as wouldn't quote evil or like there. I know. Yeah. They're morally wrong. And I think we just have a system of really horrendous incentives. And I don't blame someone in an environment where in a world, in a country where money and financial security is so important, so different for your quality of life, do wanting their house to go up and value. Yeah, of course. And so, you know, and it's hard. I mean, I do blame the politics. There's a case for me. It's the politician. It's hard to blame the politician when the only people that show up to their town council meetings are 200, 300 people who all tell them don't build this. This is a chain. That's why it's a chain of like, it's a huge chain of bad incentives. It's like the politician who primarily needs these like people who attempt their meetings and needs their money and needs their votes to like stay in power. So you need to appease them. They want their house to go up and value because the maybe further, they want security because the social systems don't exist in place for your kids to just go to school for free and like be guaranteed to, like pretty guaranteed in life to succeed in a general sense. Don't say you're trying to help the population. I agree. I don't know. I know. I know. They say they're right here. It's hard. Shame whether it's what I mean about the crime. This is what I mean. Kind of what I was saying about the crime thing is I don't want to be immediately dismissive. Even I know, even though I know if you actually dig into that, it's like not really true or like you're kind of acting against your own interests over time is like, I don't think you want people to say that. And I understand that feeling. The difficulty here is most people, I think most people don't really, they don't think about it in that way. They don't really, they aren't thinking about that chain of incentives or like the nuance of the issues because they're just looking at the short term incentive right in front of them and then acting primarily based on that. Of course. And that's what makes this topic like so frustrating to tackle. And admittedly as a guy who like I recognize, I'm not, I'm not fleeing to like a perfect place or something. But when I think about the problems in America that bother me the most and how they're going to affect me later on in life, if I lose my job or if I get sick or if I have a family, I, I don't know what it takes in this country to make changes around this stuff. And this is actually my main core critique of the whole book is that I do believe that they are stating a better vision of the future, a better vision for the Democratic Party, a better way to step forward in general. But the disconnect is like, what can we do at like a base, um, base level to like jump and start making these changes? I don't know how to get this. And people who are like really left are going to start saying like revolution and organize and people on the right are going to say like vote Republican and vote Trump and like take steps in that direction. And I don't, it's like I, the details of like how to progress in like a good direction are very vague to me and uncomfortable. And I don't have the answers. That's what where I get to when I think about these topics is when you talk about this giant chain of incentives. That is, I, how do you tackle an issue like that? I think this is going to sound crazy. We're solving it right now. And I'm not, I'm being a little hyperbolic. But I think his book, I think talking about this, I think us explaining it, it's, he makes this case. He was out of pocket talking about this. If enough people sort of see this and reward a poll it like reward poll it with more attention or support for for standing up to the people in the room and saying, Hey, listen, there's 200 of you in here and I understand your constituents and I understand you want to stop the building for whatever reason you say. But there's also 10,000 20,000 30,000 people who will benefit from this being built and their mechanist students do they might move to this city and the housing guys might go down millions people might be benefit. So I have to think about all that and I have to, if people are rewarded for that, people understand that and voters reward that then they have an incentive to do that. Right now nobody cares or notices or even understands this problem. So I think explaining the problem, I think, I mean, what you're doing, it makes a lot of sense and I think people will have not heard of this, won't understand. I actually think, maybe it's naive, but I think it actually does help. If enough people, if you can articulate a problem really easily and digestively, I think you've done a good thing because people can understand, explain to their friends, word of mouth spreads, and then there is an incentive. Then you get a win as a politician when you talk about this and you say, isn't he built it? Yeah. So for people on the, on the left, at this point, I consider myself a moderate in the middle. I have become so roast out by this type of behavior on the left that I, and I would love a Democratic party that feels competitive and that they're where I actually believe them when they say they're caring about, you know, impoverished groups or the middle class, but I don't because what you're actually doing in these states is pricing everybody out and making people suffer and then objectively the red states are doing better. They are gaining the people. And so there's two things here. I mean, if I could push back a little, you might be doing better on this specific issue because I think like even when you like, like if you look at, we could look at something like crime stats. If you look at percentage of like violent crime, it's often the poorest red, like, red cities. No, it's not like, I won't say Mississippi and Alabama are doing it. It's not like red cities and red states are like magically, like magically doing better on the whole. I think this issue of housing is like in places like Texas and Florida, I will acknowledge that there is success. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me, let me address the nuance. As you can probably tell, I'm a little heated about this because I have just my favorite city in the world is San Francisco, and I have been so frustrated as my friend and I have followed a lot of the politics there. And I also people who I can perceive to be hypocritical who say one thing and do and act against it. Of course. That annoys me more than like our public and guys just like, fuck minorities. You know, like, like, which I think, okay, but even I get here. There's a lot of that guy doesn't really exist. That guy, that guy, those guys do exist. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Those guys do exist. Like, I think most, I think most people who are voting like, voting, this kind of goes back to what we were talking about in like the the German election episode is like, I do think there's a version of people that are just paving and throwing a vote to the other side that are like the like, this is just so fucked up in California or this is so fucked up in Seattle. And like about basics, I'm not talking about like even ideological stuff. I'm talking about the basic that this is like the undercurrent of everything is like, can me and my family afford to live in this place anymore? And how it like, like, I can pressure people afford to live here. Can I, the way my life is like economically affected day to day and, uh, and then they kind of, they go off to the other side in hopes of something changing. Yeah. That's you, if you're I talked about this a lot, by far, the reason people voted for Trump when you look at exit polls, it's not because of abortion or social issues. It is, it's not because whatever they think, tariffs are, he's awesome or whatever it almost every like the vast majority, right? It's because affordability. It's because of it. It's because of it. It's because of it. It's with it. There's people are saying we're struggling because we can't afford to live a good life. And like, and so I feel like we should be laser focused on that. And that's, and, and you know, again, a few nuances here again. I'm not saying I'm supportive of, of, I would not consider myself Republican at all, but, and I strongly disagree with them on social issues. But it went housing in particular, as far as I can tell, the only success stories in America are in certain red cities. And that is just like, I think there's two things if you're on the left. One is the moral issue. To me, it feels gross to see that objectively your policies are causing more homelessness, eroding the middle class, making life harder for poorer and minority groups. Like, it's a moral issue. If you actually give a shit, let's change what we're doing. And the second is a practical, even if you don't care about other people and you're only out for yourself. The left is losing. They're losing people in these states, right? You can't keep doing this and retain power if you are a Democrat. Like this isn't going to work in the next couple years. Yeah. California. So if you look at the, and you're even within like really blue dominated spaces, right? In cities, in states, it's like a lot of these blue states did not vote for Trump overall, right? Like the votes didn't go to him. But if you look at the percentage shift, right? Yeah. It's crazy. I don't think they're voting for Trump. I think they're voting against how the left leaning governments are governing, particularly with regards to housing and affordability. And so I'm curious, you guys, thoughts. This is certainly not where I'm an expert. I haven't gotten to, I haven't finished the book. I haven't gotten to where he's suggesting solutions. Although my understanding is the criticism of this book is that he doesn't really have a lot of solutions. It's much, it's much more, here are all these problems and not what we do. My, my takeaway from this is my, it's a really oversimplify this in the 70s. The government and also broadly, we're building too much and harming a lot of the climate environment people in all these different ways. And so we added a massive amount of regulation and a mass amount of lawyers and a mass amount of process. And now we're on the far opposite end of that where we can get nothing built and everybody is suffering. Presumably, we land somewhere in the middle. And the only way I see to do that is to deregulate that we have to peel, peel back a ton of these different things. I think Seika probably needs to be repealed. I love the environment. I don't want the environment to die, but when that law is being used countless times to stop any development in California, which it can do and is used for constantly. We can't have that. There can't be all these processes. When you see the story of the bridge that got burned down and we were able to rebuild it in two weeks, is it like, are we, is it really worth trying to make sure every single person on earth is happy with what we're doing? If it means nothing gets built and, and we just move, we just build things. And the only way I see to do that is deregulating, which makes me even sadder about Doge, because Doge is something that should be good, which is like, let's make an effort as a country to deregulate and to like eliminate a lot of the process that has just built up over the decades. And instead, he's doing it in the most abrasive and unlikable way, even though obviously I like it because I love everything about Elon Musk. But it's like, I really think that's sad because like, man, dude, if, Trump and Elon weren't being so antagonistic and focusing on like, we need to eliminate vote contracts and all this shit, like, they should be a bipartisan issue. We should be pushing to like every, we should build more stuff. And we aren't. And I don't see any world out of that. Other than we got to really fucking remove regulations. I'm curious what you guys think. I want to say, I think one interesting argument he made and your word brought it up there, I think people are going to have this instant reaction. I want to bring it up. Is especially, in politics, especially because we're so polarized, there's words that have become, you call trigger words, words that have become so powerful that it conjures up some images in your mind. You can't really think about it. D-regulation is one of those words. It's one of those words that people aren't able to look at rationally. Really, regulations is just a rule. Some rules are bad. We need to figure out the right rules, right? I think it was worth it. But when people hear, especially in the left, they hear deregulation. They think of a guy pouring toxic waste into the river. Next thing. That's the first image that comes to mind. I think he's doing a good job with it. I think it's why the power part of this book is getting people to understand that just because the regulation doesn't mean it is a good thing, we have to find the good ones and get rid of the bad ones. Yeah. I mean, the first thought that I had was around that comes to my mind is not necessarily the environmental regulations, but the idea of reducing regulation means unfettered spending and private companies making decisions rather than private corporate interest being at the wheel of things. That's what pops into my head. But I think that's the important part. It doesn't have to come with that. I thought a really important section of the book was when he was talking about the efficiency of government agencies and talking about how so many things within these agencies, because of not only the rules they have to comply with, but the funding behind those agencies, they outsource those things to private companies. A common thing is an agency might bring on a company like Deloitte to do a bunch of stuff. These agencies don't have a lot of... The way he broke it down was really nice, is the capacity of the agencies need to be strengthened. That means in some cases, there needs to be cuts, and in some cases, there needs to be growth. The agency and the people within the agency need to be empowered to execute, rather than outsourcing to more private companies that bog down the process. Because again, we're being subservient to more of the government institutions around them that make them check off a bunch of boxes that also inhibit the process. He talked a lot about basically state capacity to execute things. Yeah, I understand that. If you're a government agency and you outsource the Deloitte, Deloitte's incentive is to make this shit take as long as possible and to bill you for as many hours as possible and to overcharge you as much as possible. Which is why it's psychotic if I may that that one of the big criticisms is I have of Joe a doge, criticisms of doge is that they're not cutting defense spending at all. The number one... Kick at that. It's communist. It's like the number one industry where this gets abused, where the nuts and bolts of like some privately made rathion thing cost $200 per bolt because defense contractors can get away with anything they want. And it's a massive part of our spending. It's like what 19% of like all spending. And that's weirdly untouched. I notice. Let me steal man. The ideas that they will work to that. So in I'm not sure if I believe it, but in theory, the the process of doge is going to be start with the really aggressively egregious stuff, which is like we funded this wire in Columbia. It's what I'll say. I'm just going to come out and say this. What a load of shit. Why would you not start with the thing that has the most it is the most impactful thing on the budget every year? Why would you not start with that? Why would you even I think you did the math on this? I want to say I've seen other people do the math on this. If you cut every government like agency and employee, if you fired everybody, you took away all the government spending that does not have to do with a Medicare defense or interest payments and social security. It makes like no impact. It has almost zero impact. So you need if you actually want to accomplish this goal, you have to attack. It's like presumably we all want to keep Medicare and social security. At least most of us do like that. I think there are a few people in positions of power that have started talking about cutting that. But in general, like no person really wants those things to be cut. The interest payments work. We can't cut with no choice. So the next thing you can go do is defense an industry rife with this with rife with abuse for multiple reasons. Yes. And I think it's like so frustrating that it's not starting to get stuck. That's the it's I just I'm baffled by it. It's like how they decided what we should start with is by going after essentially ideological ideological battles, right? Which is here's every potentially woke. They're trying to turn the mice trans or whatever. Because they're doing tests about estrogen or whatever. It's like that doesn't fucking matter. Like go for it. Go for these like large scale fraud or the military whatever. And so I totally agree. And it's like I hope that those succeeds because I think this is an effort that is important, which is to reduce the amount of waste in the government that reduce the right. Obviously these are good things. And it sucks that they have made it so ideological. Why are you doing that? This I mean, this is I mean, you laid out right? It's like if we were to come back to like basically the root of this discussion, which is like building more in America. So that more people more people have housing, which is something that everyone should have access to and like no one should have to like no one should have to live out in the street. It's like that is a basic thing. And I'm hoping you're right in what you brought up is like if we talk about that more, this should be something really simple and straightforward that we can agree on. Something like very base and to everyone's like for based. Yeah. Two quick follow points while you're bringing up that thing. One, I just want to reiterate that that for me, the reason I am so passionate about this stuff is because I want everybody to have a better life. And I see building as so critical to that not only on a long scale of making our day to day like our livelihoods of inventing cures to medicines and making people's lot giving more opportunity to people, but also just housing and how clearly important that is. And I just get incredibly frustrated at all the efforts to stop it. And yeah. So that's part of it. And then also I just want to reiterate what you said, which is that to me, deregulation does not mean let private companies come in and like fuck over the little guy, right? But at this point, there are it seems that every process in so many different parts of our government, really fucking smart about the rules. Right. And it really gives people more agency, right? More dynamic than that. I think something interesting to think about is the, I don't know if we could go back to old man Lee Kwan you know, if you were to work in public service basically, if you're to be the equivalent of like an agency worker or a politician in somewhere like Singapore, my understanding is that's like a very sought after like well compensated job, like kind of the equivalent and people can correct me on this if I'm wrong. This is what my understanding is is it's kind of like the equivalent of like going to become like a lawyer or a doctor like you it's just a career that is like lauded in that way. And like getting into a position like that and being someone who's like attacking the issues. It's like it's it's very valued among your peers to like be the person to step up and do that. I think that's just something I don't know. Interesting to think about. Yeah, it's a back up what I was saying and then all of this last thing like just talking about the to give some specifics about the amount of of of agencies and parties who are all trying to put their hands in these projects and all having an influence and all having to say and the unbelievable amount of slow down and cost that adds. So this is from role and Sal's been from the book. So the problem with these laws that we have is that they're indiscriminate. It's as easy to obstruct an oil refinery as a wind farm. So you have the National Environmental Environmental Policy Act. You have the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Clean Water Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and the National Forrest Management Act. There are over 60 federal permitting programs that operate in the infrastructural proof over a gene and they then list how they're trying to build a wind farm in Wyoming, which is clean energy, which we need to solve the climate crisis. Currently, it's set to release in to be finished in 2026, which is 18 years after it was proposed. 18 years. So it's like, all right, if you care about climate, good wind. We can't go with this. The planet is going to burn if we burn the best windmill. The best windmill. It's like, yeah, okay, that's great that every single migratory bird got a hearing and like I love birds, but like do we need to in every single project? He loves birds. How these people have agency and sometimes that means where like certain groups are going to be fully represented and have everything you want in that stuff, but you have to make trade-offs because otherwise nothing happens. Even in the Villain Chair, Doug loves birds. You never let that go. That's what I love about Doug. I would, do you know what birds I would kill for that wind farm? I kill a lot of birds. Fuck it. Everyone shoots a regulation goes on. So you brought this up. Okay, I want to bring this up because I while I agree with everything you said to be honest, I think we talked about before even this book came out because we saw that yeah, think piece by Israel while I'm back. Yeah, yeah, I agree. I think there's many rules that have not done what they're intended. The age-old apocryphal story is like in the British Raj India, they made a rule to ban cobras and they said if you bring us a cobra skull because they want to kill the cobras, you bring us a cobra skull will pay you some money. That's we're going to kill the cobras. People started breeding the cobras because there was money in it. Like rules are doing the opposite of what they were intended to. Even if they have good intentions, they're against them. I just want to say, I think there's a tendency to hear this speech and be like, well, I'm pretty interested in Doge. And I just want to say that I have been so deeply disappointed with Doge on every level. And I have at this point no hope or goodwill towards it when I look what's actually happened and what cuts have actually happened and so much the chaos it's induced and the actual cuts that have met. Now this purple line here is our current budget deficit so far this year. It is bigger than it was in 2021 in 2020 in 2020. Is in 2020. 2020 is the dark blue one. 2020 is the black one. It's the one that spikes up there in the half of the year. I see. But so far in this year. So you see the purple one on the top right. We're in February. We are above all the previous years. We are currently spending more than any year of Biden or Trump from one. But I don't understand. We canceled the $7 million. That's what it did. It was not trans and the virus. We are spending more money and this is before the new $5 trillion tax cut comes in. So this deficit is going to be low. It is going to be a lot of money. Those tax cuts are continuing tax cuts. That won't do it anymore, right? New. The continuing tax cuts are already baked into the pie. They've already assumed to be okay. More tax cuts. We are this and house today. I mean, this is like three hours. Well, maybe no, no, but there's a $5 trillion new bill from the house that is a $5 trillion tax cut over the next 10 years. And it's going to balloon this deficit. And it will make up for 10 acts of whatever doge is even possibly cut. We are nowhere close to getting even to like, you know, five years ago, level of budget, which is already bad. We are not on track the financial prudence at all under those or not. And so I just, I am personally sick and tired of people who I thought I agreed with. Like there's some of them to be concerned. I'd be like, I agree with balance budgets. I agree with getting shoulder national debt. And then when they get into the power, they don't do any of that. So I'm sick of, again, people on the left over regulating. But I'm also sick of people saying they want to get this stuff in order and doing nothing substantial or any real buts. I guess I'm frustrated with politicians. This whole douchebag is like, God, it was one of the most unique opportunities. No politician is incentivized to cut budgets. No, right? They're solely incentivized to get more money for their constituents. And this is one of the rare cases where you had a president, Donald Trump, who got elected, who was saying he's going to like, balance the budget and then set up doge and gave it this ridiculous amount of access to whatever it wanted. This is like, in on paper, should be the best chance for this to work. And they're fucking it up. And it's like, God, man, I want it to work. I hope it works. But I agree right now. It's just all ideological and doesn't seem to be doing anything substantial. And it's sad. It's really sad. I agree. Yeah, I agree. But at least Tesla stock is up. So let's go. You know why it's up? Because tariffs and coincidentally, Tesla's are made in America. So I did see that. And you sold all yours. That's what I wrote. I'm like, oh shit. I'm gonna say it's up for winning. I still don't really believe in the long term value of the stock. But if a stock is $100 and drops 90% and then rises 90%, it's now at $19. Okay. So it's it's up a couple percent. But it's down overall. I stopped. You know, thief. There is it's funny because we can keep going. But you touched on something that I thought the book, I wish I saw more in the book was talk about taxes. Because I think taxes do tie pretty deeply in all these things. But we are out of time. But I did want to touch on a few comments from last week. A few corrections for a few. Pretty critical thing I thought. A lot of people pointed this out. I mistakenly said that over the hedge too exists. I'm glad you're answering this because this is a good floor show. Yeah. This I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I forgot that over the hedge did not get a sequel. I made that up. I bad. I so I'm going to go on the right. That's not going to have to talk about Tucker Carlson. Thanks to you. Tucker would never make that error. And also on the movie. Tucker is for the car. Get animated movies on the over the hedge. Of course. Universe. Tringer stood no. Okay. So one more thing on the movie front. I thought this comment was interesting because we talked a lot about how Yolo was the an original movie that came out of China. Someone had a soft correction on this, which is we mentioned a movie called Yolo that was 14th in the box office last year. It's an adaptation of a Japanese movie by actress director. Interesting. G.A. Ling who also had the third highest grossing movie in 2021. Global. She's one of the highest grossing female directors all of all time after after Greta Gertwig. Yeah. That movie in 2021 was called High Mom, the English title, is an incredibly moving semi-autographical movie about a woman who time traveled to become her mother's best friend after her mother died prematurely of an accident. Dealing wrote it about it. You're really just advertising China again. Yeah. We're talking about her own guilt and grief about her mother who also passed away due to an accident. It made $841 million at the box office and was a smash hit. So I thought that was just an interesting note because I had not heard of this director until you mentioned. Well, there was a comment on that also I didn't know about. The department is actually a remake of a Chinese movie. Yeah, Hong Kong, I believe. Hong Kong movie called Infernal Affairs. But I think we are recognized that for a citizen in America, seeing the department feels like a fresh new experience. Yeah, it's and seeing Kung Fu Panda for it. It's absolutely different than a different people. Yeah. I think it's interesting about the is that we as Americans are learning more and more about, oh, wow, there's this Chinese director who had this incredible success. Oh, wow, there's this movie. There's this movie. Like I watched again, Zah, Nezah, which I can't pronounce. But like I was like, wow, this is a very good movie. And it again makes me a little concerned about the future of America because this idea that we moved up the value chain. It's like, I think that's because everybody else is taking time to catch up. I don't think we're inherently better at tech or movies or any, like, I don't know. The American industries don't feel nearly as protected anymore because turns out Chinese people can make movies just as good as us. We're not inherently better because we grew up in America for some fun and reason. Yeah. So it's tough like that. Like I think that's fantastic. I'm so excited about that. And if you want to hear a little, little concerned about the American infrastructure in middle class, I agree. And if you want to hear more from CCP propaganda's Doug, you can do this on the next week, next week of lemon. Wait, real quick. Yeah. I thank you for listening. If you watch this episode as a somewhat serious personal note, this is a big reason why I wanted to do this podcast is to talk about things like this that I'm very passionate about. We're obviously not going to solve every single problem in any way, share, perform. But I am really passionate about stuff like this as you can maybe tell. So thanks for listening and if you are being interested. I love this. Did I love this? I think that's fine. But I just think these are important conversations. And I feel I feel glad to be able to contribute to them a tiny bit. And we read your comments and I would love to hear it. If you have a thoughtful idea on something that was said here, I would love for you to write it. If you can approach it in like a. But you're a cash tax. No, I was like, bots dude. No, it's not like bots. It looks terrible. No, no, no, no. Wait, you think it's a little bit terrible or opening it and looking at our comments and look like they're all from bots because they have a beautiful way to solve this. I have a beautiful way to solve this. If you have a good, if you're one of the good faith and ease in the chat, you would like to make a comment because we do read all the comments. And I think a big part of my enjoyment of making this show has been doing people's comments. Also a discord on the way. A lot of people have asked about discord, Patreon, stuff like that coming in the near future. But there'll two little carrots at the end of your message because it's the like a cute eyes. The problem was that it wasn't cute. No, no, no, no. That was cute too. Now it's not a pretty good image of me. Okay. And maybe you could put the underscore between them for the face. Okay. From the first episode you did that to the last episode, the Merf people who did this drop by like 98%. I noticed. There's like five people who did it last episode. We're going to have one guy who's going to do it. This is a little secret conversation. Can you make all the episodes? I will only read comments if the character you put at the end is very cute just to be clear. Like it's not just enough for the carrot. It has to hold. You know what you can do? You can like on your phone, you can install the Japanese keyboard and then they have you have a select. Dude, they have a set list of like their own like text emojis. I want you to know you're not required to install the Japanese keyboard to leave a comment. Don't leave a comment. I'm going to read it. You should have said you want me to read it. Sure. I'll read it anyway. Thank you guys very much for watching. Thank you guys for watching. Next time, where's that lemon you're going to eat? I'm not eating. No more lemons.\\n\\nI'm not saying it's not awful. I'm telling you that layer. Your brain is running. No, no, it looks like a video game. And that's removal of the human element is real. And I do want to be clear, this is not running over dogs. This is the right yard on a street. I've already claimed it. No way. Hey, I got a question. I asked much at this. If we could saw off Texas, loaded out to the ocean and then float Australia in where Texas is, first of all, would you do it? And second of all, what do you think it would do to the character? No, it would fill up the Gulf of America. We can't have it. We have to rename it to the Gulf of Australia. We just renamed it. No, we want to go through that whole process. Do it. I don't redo all my globes. It is a pain. Just really, you know, all things considered. But welcome back to the second episode of Lemonade Stand. That was for a couple of seconds. Welcome. Well, then I didn't finish. What if you're driving through New Mexico to Florida? And then you got to hear somebody say, good night, Kabah. That's your best. That's the one that's how you do a better one. No, that's not what we don't need that. We don't need that. I saved that for the other show, you know? That's I don't think I don't think that would be. I don't think you would even wouldn't be that. I'm defending it now because you're making me mad. Wouldn't it add some charm to America? We don't have enough accents, first of all. You're really concerned. That's a segment. We can do the death of regional accents. I just feel like I think TikTok is really bad. It wouldn't be that bad because you could go the entire distance on a single drive using Tesla's new full self driving features. Which you don't even have to put your hands on the wheel for 99% of situations. And what a segue from the master because today's topics are focusing on Tesla. Is it doomed to fail? Or will it come out on top specifically with how it handles itself driving technology and also the future of self driving cars in general with both of you taking one side of the debate. You're already doing your moderator voice. My moderator voice. I'm clocking in. I'm the judge. And then I think we're also going to be talking about Pokemon Go becoming property of the Saudi Arabian crown, which I know we were all Edging for waiting for and lastly, public transport in America. And how we're going to solve it right here on the podcast. In the next two hours, we'll have the whole thing sorted. That's what I hope for this whole show is that one by one each episode. Us three guys solve every problem in America. And it goes up until we sell the podcast of the Saudis. Yeah, I've been in talks. I'm looking for. I'm already looking for my way out. We're at the episode and show like this is our exit strategy. At some point we're IPO and we're going Saudi. You know, it's looking for a way out. It's Tucker Carlson. Yeah, he's number 11. Maybe we knocked him out on the top 10. That guy's desperate. He said, I mean, I think it's weird that Vladimir Putin hasn't reached out to do an interview here. Just not even bigger reach. Yeah. How do you think that works? Do you think you just get like what's the KGB email domain that you get in your inbox? Yeah. You said you would do it in Russia. You said if we did that interview, you literally wouldn't do it. I would be terrified on a question. If Vladimir Putin reached out to lemonade stand, he would do an exclusive interview with us in Moscow. You're absolutely. Yes. I would do it. Dude, I would do it, but I'd be shit and bricks the whole time. Because you can't, you have to go softball mode. You don't drink the tea. You don't drink the tea. You don't take the free snack. Even that Tucker interview isn't even an interview. It's, it's Vlad doing 45 minutes on the history of Russia. We get him on the podcast on the presentation board. And then he's done history lessons. He's doing what he normally does, which is drawing. He's done what he's done. Vladimir Putin's over like the Balkan region. This, this used to be ours. I don't know the presentation laws fire. All right. But as far as this like debate goes, I think you guys are both taking sides of the argument, not necessarily the exact sides that you agree with like personally, but you are more Tesla doomer. This company is going to flame out. Yeah. And you are vouching for the side of Tesla is going to make it and how they're going to do. Yes. And I want to be very clear to people listening. I do not love Elon Musk. I do not agree with every so much of what is happening for the sake of argument. He's a personal. I am going to be communicating the potential upsides of Tesla and of what Elon Musk is doing. And I know that people are going to say, oh my god, they're going to stop it there. They're going to cut their going to watch the first two minutes of the show. I can't believe that personally endorsed Elon Musk on the show. You think you should leave all those kids in the dirt? I the full all 14 kids in the dirt. I think you should give us one of them. We need to take one of the kids. We need a video editor for our shorts and the kids know what's up on TikTok. Have you seen the clip of him walking off the stage and leaving his kid behind? It is. I don't in a vacuum like that's, you know, I was a kid once. I got lost in the grocery store on occasion, but it is funny to just leave your kid in the dust as he like walk and wave to the fans and the crowd. I'm not sure I clips real. I think I think I heard it might have been. It's fake. It might be fake. I've been got. It's not fake, but there's more. I'm already a Paul doesn't. It's very. You guys are literally saying something wrong. He goes and gets his kid and he brings him over. That's what I'm saying. It's like, oh, Ducksmith, the whole podcast defending Elon Musk. You guys are saying this is not what happens. This is a good exercise. It's just literally not what happens. I'm correcting the narrative because I would like, like I said, you guys can do this. You can just say wrong shit about Elon. Then I have to look like the dick sucker who's going to come in and be like, actually, no. No. Easy money. Yeah. I put on the internet opinion side. This is an easy side of the argument to be on, but I'm going to try and go at it from a business angle, which is that I am not making the argument that Elon Musk sucks. It doesn't matter to me. Like I mentioned, I talked about it on the stream. I'm not a big fan of Jeff Bezos, either, but I own Amazon stock, right? What I'm saying, I'm making an argument here is that I think Tesla isn't a really negative position going into the future that I'm not confident in their ability to execute and that they're in a more spot. That's what I'm going for. I like that idea of the conversation because similarly, like I'm not a fan of Elon Musk personally, and he's not my best friend like Doug. Right. Even that pose is on your wall like he does. I do think there's this idea that like anything he touches or is associated with is automatically bad. I saw like SpaceX catch the rocket for the first time. I'm like, that is, that is so cool. So I like to see like the version of this argument that extends way more past like Elon Musk sucks and is like, what is the actual financial situation behind the company right now? Because from my understanding, it's pretty grim at the moment. Yeah. I mean, I could jump in. You want to go to the patented presentation wall or do you have something to work on? You want to kick off like your overview like high level argument about what's going on with Tesla and then we can back up and talk about what's going on with self driving. Because ultimately, I think what underpins almost all this conversation is self driving cars. That is what Tesla is betting on. It's not really about how many model wise they sell. And so we'll dive into that. I'm going to compare way more in Tesla. But what's your like kind of fundamental core argument here? I would say my fundamental quagmint is it is about how many model wise they sell. Okay. Are you the selling cars? Is what matters for a car company? This is a futures company. Okay. Yeah. My quagmint is that, you know, as much as we extrapolate all these different things he's doing, the money that the company makes is from selling cars. That's what it is for. And they're not selling as many cars as they used to sell. So that's a problem, right? And the company, I mean, I can go into my presentation. Can I pull it up? I want you to get up there. Yeah. I feel like I need to show some grabs and charts to get up there. Plus I love this patented presentation wall. You think Tucker Carlson could get a PowerPoint? No, you can't do it. You can't even open PowerPoint. Do you think Tucker Carlson can kind of awkwardly stand and cover the left side of the TZ for most of the PowerPoint? He just can't do it like that. You imagine having Xi Jinping here for a guest and we're like following with power over 15 minutes. Right. I do like the idea of this like CCP secret service equivalent like scoping the place for bugs and insprison sorting through fake and lemon and lime cans sodas. And I'm going to hide one. I'll go in there. All right, I'll go real quick. All right. This is a much longer presentation I did on my own channel, but I want to catch you guys up and want to think about Tessas lately. All right. Here we go. First of all, Texas. We got 44 wheels throwing off a Tesla in the parking lot. We got super charges on fire and Massachusetts. We got protesters arrested in New York. We got protesters arrested in Georgia. We got a paint and vandalism and Berkeley. We got shots fired in Oregon. We got swastikas drawn on cars in Europe. Okay. And three months ago, none of this was happening. Elon Musk, $400 billion richer than Manta Moussa and John D. Rockefeller, rich man and human history. Richard and every single fictional rich person combined according to four. Much richer than the street. No, I can't be richer than this. And then in the past three months, Tesla drops 50%. All right. Astronomical amount to drop. It's $800 billion of market cap lost. That's equivalent to, I'm going to skip ahead here. Toyota Mazda Subaru Ford Nissan Riviera Honda Ferrari Porsche Mercedes-Benz Aston Martin on Dekia, VW GM and BMW combined all going to zero in three months and then lighting $10 billion on fire on top of that. So it's, you know, it's a significant loss. Like it's worth talking about. From a business P.O.V. for me, it's fascinating because that's, that's not normal. That's like, that's, that's, I think about something like Enron collapsing. That was like 20 billion. And that's, that's nothing by comparison. So, so it's a big deal. And you could say, if I asked why people might show you this clip of Elon possibly seek Highling, possibly Roman saluting. And, you know, you could point to that as one political thing, but I want to go into a deeper business context, which is that basically, sorry, skip, skip this. You had the Iron Man two screenshine there. Yeah, you could point to him being Iron Man, you could point to him cheating and path of eggs, all you could point to all that. But the whole point is that regardless of what you think about all this stuff, it's causing a reputational problem with a certain class of consumer. And these people used to buy a lot of EVs. So in every country they sell in other than China, Tesla's reputation score keeps falling. For a business, regardless of politics, that's just bad, right? That just means it's harder to sell cars, especially when if you do the math, and I got a little craft here. I mean, Aiden, you want to guess what the top 10 states that bought EVs voted for in this election? I think they were blue or red. Oh, tough call, tough call. Well, they were all blue. I'm going to go blue on that. They were all blue. This is 2020 election. I don't know the data from, but, and then what do you think about the 10 states that bought the least EVs? I mean, they were red. They're red. They're red. Yeah, you guessed it right. They're red. So it's like, even if you're switching one consumer for the other, you're going to be red. In the states that are red, they're just buying, they don't care as much about EVs. Their town's not even as many chargers. It's not, the infrastructure's not there. They don't care as much. And so it's not a one to one trade to piss off one group for the other. If you're an EV car selling company. So, you know, I got this poll here. 55% Republicans say there's no chance at all they'd ever buy an EV in the next decade. That's a tough market to sell into. That's a hard pivot. If you sell cars, all right? Second thing, we're possibly entering a recession and late car payments right now. This article is from like three days ago. Have hit the highest level since they started recording the data. So people are just are not making their car payments, especially subprime, which makes it a weird time for Tesla to be offering 0% down 0% APR loans. It's like 2006 for housing. Dude, there's doing a bunch of this like car giveaway that I think will be problematic if people can't pay their bills. So from a business side, I get all this stuff makes me nervous about investing in Tesla, right? Then I look to the top 10 countries they sell in is down 76% in Germany, down 63% in France, down 70% in Canada, down 81% in Australia, down 38 Norway, 44 in Sweden. It's going to come up later. So I'm going to interject. Okay. This is recent. This is like last twoish months, right? This is correct. So I was actually going to ask that a version of that question because my understanding was relative to the rest of the EV market, they were already starting to trend down because of the basically quality of EVs offered by other companies. So is this accelerating from that? And it sounds like yes. Yeah, there's also an art, so which we'll talk about later. There's also an argument test the model why is their biggest selling car by far? That's like almost all of Tesla sales. It's one of the best selling cars in the world. Right now they're doing a refresh and they're releasing a new version of it in like a month or two. So in the last two months, Tesla has been pitching the thing of we are releasing a newer, better version of model Y extremely soon. So that could justify and who knows exactly how much some amount of people no longer wanting to buy the main car that Tesla's selling, right? 100% like you wouldn't buy the PS5 if the PS6 is coming out in two months for the same price. 100% and it's also worth saying like if your Q1 sales are down from Q4, well, Q4 is the end of the year. You make big purchases. Christmas time. Yeah. But this is a pretty, this is not a normal amount of drop and they're down year over year too. So they're down over January of last year. They're down. They're just down. So you know outside of the UK, 9 out of 10 of these countries, it's down, right? So that's a bad look in general. And I think it's because listen, in China, nobody cares about most politics. They don't care. They actually think it's the coolest tech guy. They still think it's Tony Stark. There's not, there's not a lot of like anti-Elon sentiment pumping on a way, though. No. On Billy, Billy, he's still based, okay? They have no problem. They're living the Iron Man to a dream sale. They still think he's Iron Man. But the problem is, you know, there's other Iron Man's now in China, which is mainly this company, BYD, Bill, your dreams, who is offering Tesla like cars for way less that are built for the Chinese market. So they have just massively outstriped Tesla sales recently. And because they're made in China, they're built by a Chinese company that knows what Chinese consumers want. They're just getting out competed. So that's like another pressure on Tesla that makes me scared again to be an investor. Quick thing. Yeah. I was curious, I have either of you ridden in one of those. A BYD? No, I have you. A BYD model? No. I did. And when I went to Mexico recently and a ton of the Ubers are BYDs. And I was in a pretty like base cheap model. Okay. Very nice car. It was like, it was super functional. I asked the guy, I used Google Translate to talk to my Uber driver. I know. I love talking to Uber drivers. But and he was talking about how much he loves the car and how good and like useful it's been for specifically his job. And the inside of the car was awesome. Like I mean, a lot of like new cars are nice, right? But I was like, I was pretty impressed. And it was my first time ever riding it on. I was considering driving down to Mexico, buying a Chinese EV and smuggling it back in the United States and not pay the tariff. And then I looked up what would happen to me. The fine is astronomical and I could get jail time for smuggling. That's worth it. Do it for the pod, dude. Research. I really thought it'd be like a minus lab on the rims. The jail find. The lawyer in the jail. Right. It's a company expense. It's just a company expense. I actually, this is, I looked into, there's a model of car called the, I don't know if Perry could pull this up. It's called the Renault Twizzy. Okay. And it's a really, really tiny like street electric vehicle that I saw in Paris. Is your pin? And it costs like 15 K. Yeah, Renault is like a French car manufacturer. And I, what I looked so hard to see how you could import one of these. Like, even if you have to pay fees and stuff, but it's not, you can't make it street legal in the US. So there's no real way of doing it. Only Europeans would call a car a Twizzy. Yeah. The Twizzy. And there's no shade. We have a bigger soul than here. It's like a, basically a golf cart. It's so, it's so funny. Oh my god. Oh, wow. Yeah. No, that's cool. But yeah, I just, I was looking at this same thing. Like what would it cost to like import one of these cars that we don't have? But yeah, but. All right. So just a very quick math here. This is why this is my simple dumb business major brain. There's a thing called PE ratio. Basically, what a company's worth divided by what it actually makes and earnings. All right, a company like Ford or most car companies between five and 10. Pretty normal for a stable mature business. So this means like what they're, they're total market value is five to 10 times what they make in a year. That's right. So it's basically an idea for an investor of like how quickly you'll get your money back in a way. Okay. And it's based on, it is a really high number. That means you actually expect the number, the amount they make to go up rapidly. Because you're not going to wait 20 years. Yeah. So a company like Apple might be 35 times because it's a high growth tech company. Right. People expect the revenue to keep rising and all that makes sense because they make 96 billion dollars in profit a year. They're just a cash generated geyser profit. This is after all expenses. I'm being told to stand closer. I'm getting so heated about Apple. I love how much money they make. Google makes 100 billion in profit. Microsoft makes 88 bill. Meta makes 62 bill up 39%. Amazon makes 59 bill up 94%. In video as a PE of 60 something which is incredibly high, but they're up 144% making 72 billion pure clean cash profit. You guess what Tesla's profit was last year. I'll say, I mean, I'm guessing it's very low. I'll say something like two billion low relative to these companies. You're ruining my reveal because that's way too low. Not seven billion, but you got to like look shocked to be like, I don't know 50 billion and you set them up. You set them up for the big magnificent seven eight in. They're all seven companies are considered the big tech companies. All of them generate 50 billion plus in profits except for Tesla, which makes seven billion. I 50% decline. So their profits are way lower and they're declining. So why are they worth 1.5 trillion? The way these other companies are. That's my big question. And so now they're only down to 72 billion. But if you do their PE ratio today, it's still a hundred and one. So they're still implying a level of growth that I think is not there. So. And that's saying that the the the the market thinks that Tesla is worth 100 times what they're making in a year right? That's right. Okay. That's right. And again, what they're making, you know, it's seven billion, but like two billion of that was like Bitcoin going up. They hold some Bitcoin. So their actual profits are like closer to four. And that's just not enough to be worth seven hundred and twenty to be worth more than all those car companies elicit earlier. So that that's my my core thesis is like there's so much hope. Built into this. And so, you know, if you do the math with the normal PE ratio of like an apple, they're worth about 84 bill based on what they make and based on being value like a normal tech company. So the rest of that is all this hype of what we're going to talk about later. It's self driving. It's optimist robots. It's robot taxis. It's a possible new $25,000 car. All that stuff is what is like being hope-yummed in to this massive valuation. And I don't believe it or I don't believe all of it. You know, maybe it's like some of it might come to vision, but I don't believe those are going to come out to make billions and pure clean profit the way Apple launching a new iPad or ear buds will do. That's my that's my core business thesis here is like, I just I'm not buying it. And I got to say you on musk perhaps in the past has been less than truthful, right? I don't actually know how to put on having an ear, but he's occasionally over promise. I think even his biggest fans. He's long past a couple that long. He's on that. Okay, he's on that once or twice every year. So that's why I get, you know, if I'm an investor view of you, I get a little nervous. Thanks for a little sidetracked when they made the plane third. I don't know. Speaking of sidetracked, every dot on this chart is a tweet. You'll notice after 2022, it gets blood red. He's tweeting thousands of times a month and, you know, he's got 14 kids. He's got 10 businesses or whatever. It's like as a Tesla investor, are you really getting his full attention and value as a CEO of a 744 billion dollar company? So here's a quote from you on, I'll just end on this where we get into our big discussion. He said, when looking at our actual is from 2020 and it's kind of like a small interview. I don't think you knew this would go so big. But when looking at our actual profitability, it's very low. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits. But if at any point they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer. That's what I'm saying. If at any point, everybody has the same thought that I do, which is this is not going to happen. This stock is is worth so much less than it's currently being valued. And he's also got one more quote and then he's going to leave what we're talking about. This quote is important for me and for my point. Yeah. But the overwhelming focus is solving full self driving. So yeah. And that's essential. And like that's really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero. So that's our argument. Is it worth a lot of money or is it worth basically zero? And I think I can sit back down on the basic demanding one thing. Yeah. And that that is ultimately the crux of why anybody would think that it's worth a hundred times what it's making is that bet, which is full self driving. Should I drive into some full self drive it? I'm not a tech guy. And I can tell I have many times been impressed by the tech Tesla rolled out Tesla and Elon has rolled out. Based on Presby with the rocket grab Starlink is impressed me in some countries where you can get in saying internet. I've been impressed by tests. I'm not super recently. I feel like it's been a lot more EV innovation elsewhere, but like Tesla's impressed me the hell when they came out. So, you know, there's products there and I believe in them. But just this is my business case of like I would be so scared to put money into this company. It's basically what I'm saying. Yeah. Okay. Okay. To talk about whether Tesla is basically making a gigantic gamble on self driving. And if it lands, they become insanely valuable. And if it doesn't, they are, they are completely screwed like Elon just said. So, uh, let's step back first. And there's basically two competing tech perspectives on how to do self driving cars, which are going to dramatically affect whether or not Tesla succeeds at this giant gamble. So I'm going to start with a very obscure forest analogy that probably won't land. Okay. Imagine you have two brothers who are brilliant chefs. Okay. And they come up with a souffle recipe. A lemon souffle recipe. A truck and eight and brothers. Okay. We have done souffle. We've done souffle. Yeah. This is a souffle. souffle. These are very hard to make, right? Extra narrowly difficult. No, not for you guys. C-C-S-R-R-E-T. And by the way, you guys, my runoff twizzies, I drove you to the truck. I drive in my gum gum door. I drive my twizzies to work. I spend 14 hours making souffle. And one of the weird things is both these guys are German. The accent makes no sense. My accent was getting like fake. I rolled my arms. That's stupid. Okay. So you guys, you come out with this, out in Romania, you come up with a souffle recipe. And this is incredibly complex, but you think if you can get this out to the masses, it will be like game changing for food, right? Everybody's going to love it. And so you guys have two competing ideologies for how you want to distribute to the market. You, Aiden, are like, this is super hard to make. I'm going to go to our local fine dining restaurant, Gusto's. Okay? guys, they're, they're Michelin star, every single person, every cook, they've gone to culinary school right there, the best of the best. It's really expensive and it's slow to make anything, but these guys will get it done, right? And you go to them and they're like, will make your souffle. Over time, maybe we even make a second gusto and then a third each year, we can kind of expand a little bit. Okay. So you're thinking, okay, yes, slow, steady, careful, the top of the top, right? You, it's rock. You hit up McDonald's. 30 year. Little grime here. You hit up McDonald's, the headquarters of McDonald's, which is a Romanian. I'm a greedy brother. You're trying to bring your souffle to McAfee. Yeah. Yeah, you got to get that money. You get the combo of the McCaffes and the souffle. I don't want to drive a souffle anymore. I want to drive a nice American car. I want a nice Ford F-150. And this treats a pair. Okay. And McDonald's has 41,000 stores around the world and their pitch to you is this. Hey, no offense to anybody who works at McDonald's. We're not the greatest cooks of all time. We don't necessarily know exactly how to make the souffle. Might take us a little bit of time to figure it out. Might take us a long time to figure it out. But we're pretty sure we can do it. And if we do, boom, 40,000 restaurants around the entire world are serving you souffle. Okay. Which approach would you guys take? Which do you think is a smarter approach to getting your souffle out into the world? Well, I would ask a question. I would say does my souffle have a chance of killing people? You know what? That's a good point. Is there a little bit of poisonous? Yes. That is sprinkled in. Yeah. The ice cream machine that makes the souffle out. Might break a lot. Okay. I'd go McDonald's, maybe make that money. I made a guess of which approach you guys would take. Was that correct? You're correct. I would go the gusto's or I would go the perfectionist route for sure. Okay. So why? I don't like high level business. What's your what you're thinking? I think if you from my perspective, if you sacrifice the quality of the product, especially early on, the bad press that you potentially get about that product is so damaging. Like people's ability to value it down the line is so shaped by that first year or first couple years of the product being made poorly. And that makes it infinitely harder to standardize it later or introduce it as something positive to people later. So that's the main reason why I think I have a follow up question that's maybe related. Would you get into a Tesla full self driving vehicle right now and trust it to take you across Los Angeles? Uh, I and Tesla is telling you it's really good. They just updated it. But there's been a lot of problems with full self driving in the past, but they're telling you it's good now. And I'm just going off of I'm going off of just that update from them and no other contact. Let's say, you know, you've researched a bit, but you don't have a ton of context. The point is really how much reputational damage is there going to be when you're deciding whether to get in that car? I guess I'm going against myself because I would get in the car and try it out. I would. That was the wrong answer. You die. You you get hit by a cyber truck. Wait, I die right now. Oh, I run. You die. And McDonald's making money. This is great. So is this the way it played out? Is it is to say that it actually is this bad right now? No, it's to say that there is a fundamental divide when designing a self driving car about whether you want to make a system that has the minimal amount of tech necessary to work and get the job done and basically try to get your cars out there cheaply and efficiently to the masses and eventually get it working like a McDonald's would or if you go really slow and steady. And that is like the fundamental divide that is happening between cars and specifically with tech, it's between LiDAR versus just vision. So all EVs that are trying to do self driving have vision, which is cameras. When you say vision, it's cameras. So think of like a human being. We have two cameras in our eyes kind of. That's how we drive. Right. We. Yeah. And these are my cameras. My cameras here. And that's why you use sometimes where I. Like, right, it's like this. So all of the vehicles have cameras. And when you buy Tesla, like right now, it's like eight cameras, right? That are all around the car and could see all of around it. Now that can get you a lot of information. But as you guys know, if you've ever looked directly into the sun, it's actually hard to see sharpens the peepers. Well, if you do it often enough, you kind of strengthen. Right. Nuclear muscles. Right. Yeah, you train. Or if it's incredibly foggy or there's whatever conditions that make it hard to see, there are obvious downsides with driving, right, that make driving difficult, maybe a blizzard or a hurricane or whatever is going on. So LiDAR is light detection and ranging. It is literally shooting laser beams out of the car. And those laser beams hit the stuff around the car and then bounce back. And from that, it can make a 3D map. It's actually up behind us right now. That's what it looks like. Holy. And this is what a Waymo, which is the most successful, like fully autonomous car right now is doing. If you've seen self-driving cars anywhere, it's in a couple cities in the US. Yeah. It is literally acting like a bat. And there's that spinning kind of like siren looking thing at the top. That's a LiDAR system. So it's spinning around and literally shooting lasers at everything around it. And in ridiculous amount of definition, you get this like 3D world around. It looks like the Matrix. You know, and Neo like sees the Matrix and it's all like green things, like all green lines and everything. That's what it looks like with LiDAR. And you might think that's bad ass, right? You should do that. And it has nothing to do with light really, right? You can do this in complete darkness. And since you're shooting laser beams everywhere and fog and in doesn't need light. Yeah. And then on top of that, there's a third thing you can add in, which is radar. And if you look at the imaging here, not nearly as defined as LiDAR. Radar is what you hear about in planes and whatever else, which is that this is red dot is your puppy getting run over. These are all so bad. It's not as visceral. Because this test footage is done, they basically drive a waymo through a dog park and each of these dots. This is the email you're getting from waymo in the game. It's like it's not. It wasn't that bad. It's not that bad. It's like, do you ever look at those like wiki leaks videos that came out that Chelsea Manning leaked? And it's like the videos of them killing civilians in the helicopter. And it, but hold on. Why do you see that so casually? Yeah, because you know, watch those videos of people killing civilians. No, I didn't. The video is brutal. It looks like I'm not kidding. It looks exactly like you know what I'm not casually looking. It's not a daily thing. I don't know through less murder. It's not a bit briefly to come out of this is like what you're saying is what you're saying is kind of true. There's like these leaked videos that came out that Chelsea Manning like leaked to wiki leaks and they came out and it a video from helicopter of like civilians getting shot by the US military. And the video like looks exactly like when you call in like an AC 130 in modern warfare too. Like it's like, I'm not saying it's not awful. I'm telling you that later you're removing. No, no, it looks like a video game and that's removal of the human element is like is real. That like that that when you see something like damage like that. Yeah, I've seen does remove you from the consequence of what what is happening. Not super related to this. And I do want to be clear. This is not running over dogs. This is right now on a street. I'm sorry. No, it's not. It's not the same if it did run over dogs. It would feel less bad. It wouldn't be as bad because you're not seeing the puppy's face. You wouldn't see the puppy's face anyway. So that's your argument for radar. This is a great. It's doing. Okay, it's doing both of these things. Okay, okay. So here's the here's the core thing with radar quickly. The benefit light are is this really cool version. Right. You can see everything around you. It looks super futuristic. Yeah. It's way less so and this is older tech, right? This is shooting microwaves. They're radio waves. Sorry, they're slower. So you're not as getting as much definition, but they can go through certain types of, let's say fog and whatever else. So it's basically of two physical different wavelengths and they allow to they can kind of cover each other's gaps, right? Light are might have some gaps. Radar can cover that and then vision, which is cameras. That can see everything around you. Again, like eyeballs, right? Like you imagine. So there are three different sensors types of sensors that you can put into a self driving car that will help you to learn what's around you, right? And so what Waymo, which is the current leader in the US has done is they're making their cars with cameras all over just like a Tesla. And also there's a LiDAR system. There is that thing at the top and on the sides they have LiDAR. So it is shooting lasers everywhere while they're driving and they have radar. They have three different systems, which are overlapping and basically covering each other to make sure absolutely everything is covered and all three of these combine together in a Waymo to give it a ton of information of everything that's around it in any condition. That is their approach. They think this is the Gusto approach. We're going to go slow, careful. So the way this manifests and I think Doug might have a similar story. It's I used one of these for the first time, like a week and a half ago. And super, I was excited to just try it out and we pulled up to the, you know, getting the car, pull up to the first intersection and somebody crosses in front of us and on the screen in the Waymo, you can see the like digital person walking across. Yeah. And it's like even their finger and like hand movements, you can see their whole every movement captured on the screen. Yeah, you can kind of see it here in this LiDAR thing, like it's ridiculously detailed. And this again, you could be in pitch blackness and it would see this crazy blue my mind because we were on the way to a party that night. And while we were driving on this street, a homeless guy, a homeless guy stepped out into the street in front of the car with with his bike. He just walked out and the car slammed and got out of the way. And I saw this happen and I was like, I genuinely don't know if I would have been able to do that. As a human, as a human, if I was driving the car and it was a weirdly uncomfortably good demonstration of like it. Do you like? Do you like homeless people to go to that place? He's looking at his watch and he's like, time and his way out on the street. And they had to go through a lot of homeless people. Yeah, that's got run over right? But that's part of the nature of progress, baby. That's the business. Yeah, it's like I said last week, you got to destroy some jobs. That's not what he said. That's not what he said folks. We got enough comments. So, yeah, that more manufactured and meticulous approach, I guess I feel or I felt more confident about trying the Waymo that I would try in a Tesla. Yes. I think it's someone who's generally interested in both of these things. I'd be willing to try the self-driving stuff as well. So your reaction is probably everybody's reaction, which is Waymo and the other major autonomous driving vehicles. So Waymo for people who don't know, these cars are, they do not have a driver. There's no driver in them and they're going around Los Angeles. I believe Phoenix. I wrote it down in San Francisco right now. So they're in three cities. They're expanding rapidly. The other big one that's going on is Baidu, which is a Chinese company. They're also doing this with driverless cars in five different major Chinese cities. So there's two like major leaders right now that are currently deployed doing this stuff. And then Tesla is the other big player in the space. Tesla though does not have these systems, right? They do not have LiDAR. They do not have radar. They don't have this extra layer of knowledge and information that a Waymo has. Just cameras. Just cameras. Just. And so Elon Musk has said the following, LiDAR is a fool's errand and anyone relying on LiDAR is doomed. Pauzes doomed. Expensive sensors are unnecessary. It's like having a whole bunch of expensive appendixes. Well, that settles it. And there it is from this. And there's no business reason he might want to cut costs on safety. No. So, all right. So you probably are thinking, you know, hearing this and going like, why would you not just add the extra stuff? Like, okay. So can I, can I, can I predict the answer here? Yeah, I would love to hear what you think. I do have a thought is in Waymo, for Waymo's business model or the way the company is playing out right now. I guess that spending a lot of money to maximize the performance of each car is more acceptable in the context of the business because you don't need to sell the cars to owners. They're basically taxis that are used by a bunch of people all the time on the street in the same way that you could, that people just use like bikes for rent on the street. So you can, you can spend a lot of one, a lot of money on one car because of how often it's going to get used by a bunch of different people. But Elon and Tesla have to take a different approach because they have to make the cars affordable to individual consumers. Basically, yes. And get value out of all the millions of cars they've already sold. Right. Right. So there's two big arguments here. So again, the, the obvious response to this is like, holy shit, I'm not going to get in a car if it doesn't have LiDAR, if it doesn't have these extra sensors like why on Earth would I ever get into a Tesla and let it drive me somewhere? If Waymo has more information, more sensors to give you a sense of numbers, a recent Tesla has eight cameras on it. A Waymo has 29 sensors across these things, right? So it's not just different types. It's also just more of them. And you can see it when you look at a Waymo car, there's just more stuff on it. It does look insane. It looks insane. It looks wild. Whereas a Tesla looks like a car, right? And so why would Tesla do this? There's a couple main arguments. One is like what you said, it's expensive. LiDAR is very, very expensive. Initially, it costs tens of thousands is the estimate to put LiDAR into a car. That is completely undueable when you're talking about selling a car to an average consumer, right? It is going down in price. Waymo is like working to really, really drop it down, but traditionally it's been very expensive. And then the other, so that's the kind of obvious one. And the other is a more high level idea about how you focus your business, which is like, okay, it's great to have three complex systems, LiDAR cameras and radar in a Waymo. But now your team of engineers who have to solve this unbelievably hard problem of self-driving with all the different conditions that can happen. And to do it at a level with such an obscene amount of security and safety and redundancy, because the instant you do hit that dog, you're probably in a lot of shit. Even if you do show them that radar footage in Adon Laughs, like you're in trouble. I don't even see the dog. You're just a dog. You're a courtweight. They only share the radar footage. Like, guys, it's not bad. And so the idea here is you should focus your team on one thing, right? Instead of having your team be split into the LiDAR team, which has to make the hardware and the software for LiDAR and the camera team, which makes the hardware and software and the radar team. And then a team that brings all that together and the computing becomes more complex. Each of these cars comes with a built-in computer, which is running all of this really complex AI processing. The idea is Waymo has a arguably, that's the thinking, a bigger and more complex problem to solve, and they are more spread out. What Tesla's theory is is that human beings do not have lasers in our eyeballs. We don't shoot radar beams. Speak for, sorry, speak for myself. We don't shoot beams. Our entire road system is based around human beings looking with eyeballs. And the thinking is, if you do a really good job of making software that can just navigate roads well with cameras like a human, and in fact, Tesla's have more cameras than we have eyeballs. They have more information, right? Brue. And the roads are built for this. They should, in theory, be able to make a car that is just as good as humans. And if they can do that with way less cost and way less complexity, they're making a better product for people that can scale way better. And then the real moonshot thing, the real thing of, oh my God, if we pull this off, we win. Is the fact that right now they have four million cars out in the world. They have 400,000 with the full self-driving hardware. They, the instant it's ready, like a McDonald's, can deploy it to every single one of their cars, and instantly become the dominant player. By comparison, Waymo has 750 total cars. They're the big, cool leader. Oh my God, Waymo, 750, and their entire history. And so if Tesla pulls this off, if they focus all of their resources on this one thing, it's a, hey, we're going to do what is arguably a harder problem because we have less information on our cars. We don't have LiDAR. We don't have radar. But we have the same amount of info that a human being would have. If we get this right, the amount of payoff is absolutely astronomical because instantly we are the dominant player around the globe. All right. All right. You got a question? And this is even arguing for against Tesla as a business right now. This is simple. No, I appreciate the argument of self-driving and we have two very different competing ideologies here. Most self-driving car companies are using LiDAR and radar. Yeah. Tesla is basically the only one that's like we're going without it. And actually, an important quote, Waymo CEO said in 2021, for us, Tesla is not a competitor at all. We manufacture a completely autonomous driving system. Tesla is an automaker that is developing a really good driver assistance system. So Waymo is like, look, the only way you're going to get this right is to do it our way. You do it slow. You do it with a lot of sensors. You do this really, really, really carefully. The Gusto's approach. The Gusto's approach. Which, you know, much like Gusto's every Waymo actually has a little rat that's the power under the hood. Yeah. Yeah. He's the one guiding the laser beams at the top. Yeah. That's what the siren on top of the waymo has. There's actually 29 racks in every Waymo car. The fuel is really affordable. It's only what you have to feed to the rat. I think this is, I'm going off of everything. You've just told me right now pretty much. It sounds like the Waymo CEO is correct to me. But these are essentially two different products. That's what it feels like. Yeah. And in order for like a regulatory body to sign off on full autonomous driving, I have a hard time imagining that Tesla's approach will be okay. Like as a public service. Right. It feels like right now that Tesla's approach will never see us. We're seeing you have a lot of influence in the government. And that gets to our point. Look at her. You are teasing a wonderful factor of this conversation. I'll get you later. I, I, I, and he's too sensitive. It says like regulation would make it hard for Tesla's to get this stuff out onto the market. I don't say really. What if the government really liked you? What if the government was really, really affordable to you? I'm going to plant all along. This is a strong. I'm beginning to see the direction that this is moving in. Right? But this is where it stands, ignoring that huge factor. I would say it's hard for me to imagine Tesla's system progressing past me still having to sit in the driver's seat. Right. It's like it will be a really, really good system that still involves me being at the wheel and at least on paper having to stay like wake. Right. I, so yeah. Okay. I'm going to say, as you mentioned that we have only eyes and these have only camera cameras. Yes. And we make it work. Yeah. And it's going to be just as good as us. Problem is, I don't know if you know this, humans occasionally make accidents. We do sometimes. They definitely die driving cars. Be care yourself, but yes. I've still a few people. Vehicle man's water. So if I didn't know that I needed glasses until two months ago, and I couldn't relook down so fort. And I dogs. I think this is the other. I think you're about to get into what, what was the number one point in my mind is better than humans is not enough. Exactly. And it, I think an amazing example with this is recently, and I don't agree with like cuts to the FFA and like these, these aircraft accidents that have been happening, right? There's been a bunch of high profile, a bunch of high profile aircraft accidents. And then issue. Let me, let me play devil's advocate. She was like Boeing the year before. When the planes stay up. I like when they don't crash, but even with all of this, think about how bad the press is about like air travel right now. No, like Boeing, you could tell me, hey, Boeing has 99% of the planes stay up. That's not, that's not good enough. And that's the thing. It's way more than that. It's still with everything that's happened in the last like two or three years. It is still the safest form of transportation by a huge margin out of everything. But think about how damaging that press is. And that's what it's like with, when it's technology and a company behind it and the way of these stories like proliferate, being better than humans is not enough. It needs to be basically zero risk at all. And I feel like the only way you can get to that point is by taking this host host approach. Yeah, that's right, Matt. I just think they're opening themselves up to accidents that will already tarnish a brand that's in trouble with a lot of people. And then, you know, one thing I want to mention, one of the things Waymo's been running into is that this is a driverless car. You can get in and get out of it. People don't take care of it the way they would their own car. People are often leaving a mess or vandalizing it or leaving problems. Tessels are getting vandalized right now when they're driverless, robot taxis. I think the brand issue is core to everything and only going to get worse if they have any accidents at all. If you become even considered as walking death traps, I don't see how they can make a mass market profitable business out of that. And then, that doesn't even count the legal part of it. Now, again, I agree. It was smart of you long must to get in with the government because that gives you regulatory access to like make these things the legal rights to go on roads. And it doesn't cover you for the lawsuit if somebody gets in an accident, it's in trouble. Who's it fault with its not having car in that situation? Is it you for the as the car owner? Is it Tesla? Who's getting these big mass market lawsuits if five accidents happen, if 10 accidents happen? These things are like big problems that are not addressed. I don't think solved and I don't think have a good answer for it in a dream profitable future where they're making billions of dollars off of these. That's my you want to you want to dive into full on Tesla? Because now we can analyze Tesla and it's worth to cap off this conversation because we've basically just been talking about the two approaches to self driving cars. Right. How do I open tabs? There we go. So last year, like that quote I gave from the Waymo CEO is basically like, these are two different products. You guys are making cars where you can take your hands off on the freeway on a Tesla and it's really nice. And it currently can do that and people do that all the time. And Waymo is saying, hey, this is a car that you don't even need a driver. I do want to say one thing. And that is that the way Mo CEOs, I guess, right for right now, what the truth is, this happens in business all time. The products can be different in whatever ways their companies say they are, but they solve the same problem for the consumer. So the end consumer doesn't matter. They're a transportation solution. I'm trying to get from point A to point B consistently, whether I'm using Waymo or whether Tesla, the market share is going to one or the other. Like at the end of the day, I'm going to pick one or other things all to get things. Yeah. That problem has to be solved and someone's going to solve it and they have their own solutions, make them different, but it doesn't matter to me. I'm a consumer. I just want all my shit. So Tesla's stated goal here is to become like Waymo where these are driverless cars. So last year they did this wee robot presentation. It was very flashy, not really a lot of actual details and kind of typical Elon Musk fashion. They showed their optimist robot, which we'll probably talk about a little bit. A big thing that they talked out was the cyber cab, right, which is their this. It's their driverless version of their Tesla, right? So they are very explicitly saying we are going to be a competitor. We are not just going to be a car that assists a driver and you have to be there. We are going to be a driverless vehicle just like Waymo. We're going to be good enough and it's happening in 2026. This has no driver's seat, right? It has. Correct. Yeah. There is no ability to drive this thing. There was a cat in that just now. That was strange. They're very explicitly making that play. I don't think others are necessarily like BYD has driving assistance. BYD is a massive Chinese car manufacturer. They have driving assistance. I don't think they're proposing that they're going to be fully driverless anytime soon. But this is at least the intention. It's now we can talk about this a little more about whether it seems feasible at all. I can kick this off by saying so one argument. Again, I'm not disclaimer. I don't think Tesla is going to succeed for sure. I'm going to give arguments for why they have a real shot. I don't think it's a giant shot, but it is real. One of the biggest arguments by far is that Andre Carpathi, who's a very renowned AI scientist who led the Tesla AI and self-driving for a number of years, his thinking is basically, this is not a hardware problem. It's a software problem. It feels good to have these cool laser beams shooting everywhere. But ultimately, what is really, really, really difficult about self-driving is the obscene amount of difficulty knowing every single edge case, handling the situations when other people show up. It's this infinite amount of possibilities. I think conveniently, and maybe Waymo, the Waymo spokesman is in my brain again, and they set up this situation too, although maybe reflect poorly on them, is there's a film being shot in my neighborhood right now. And the other, and Waymo has come through all the time. And on the film set, I actually think coincidentally, they were filming a car commercial. They have police officers that block off the road with safety cones for portions of time that the filming is happening. And I watched a couple cars get stopped by the police officer, and then he's like, come on through, and he's standing out in the middle of the road next to one safety cone. Waymo comes up to him while I'm drinking my coffee, and I'm just watching this unfold. Waymo blows past the police officer. It doesn't slow down. Much like the homeless man in my experience, it just drove out of the way and kept going and drove through the film set. So as far as edge cases go, that's the one with the LiDAR technology, right? And Waymo has way more information available to it than the Tesla does, and it's still making mistakes like that. Right. I saw a video, I don't know what see this is in. Vandals wanted to basically strip away Mo. And they took, I thought it was chalk or whatever, but they just drew white lines in a circle around it. So it looked like street signs. It couldn't move. Yeah. It was just, I would not, it would freeze in place because there's a white circle around it, and then they could just do it out, it would just well move. That's crazy. And that, that would be such a sick heist movie in the future. Like, I'll never. Yeah. Just a chopper. Yeah. But that's an, these are examples of like weird edge cases that like the human driver just figures out. Right. And there's an unfathomable amount of these. And if you think about different weather conditions, different cities, the fact that when you drive, it's not just you doing your own thing. It's based on everything that happens around you and the literal infinite possibilities. If you think about it like that, getting a LiDAR system on your car that can make a 3D projected map, that's very cool. But that is, that does not solve the problem of the infinity scenarios you need to be able to handle in order for somebody to truly feel like it's safe and a city to feel like this is truly not causing a problem. So really, this is not about having all the sensors. It's about knowing what to do with the information you have. And if Tesla's argument is we have 99% of the information we need. It doesn't matter if you have that 1% more of like, yeah, cool. In a fogging situation, we can see that there is a dog that's on the other side of the road to the right, right? These, these, what's more important is that are to the dog. This is a human podcast. We don't care about the dogs. And in this case, right? And like, and obviously there are flocks to that, right? You do have a lack of information to the degree that a Waymo does. But really, this is going to come down to an absolutely obscene amount of AI and training and machine learning using data from cars in real world scenarios to figure out how do we make a system that can handle basically everything. And which car company in the world has the most data when it comes to driving cars, cars that drive? I mean, Tesla, right? Tesla has many orders of magnitude. Yeah. Because they've had cars in all their Teslas for many years. They've had millions of cars, hundreds of thousands, there are millions of cars on the road for many years. With the cameras. With cameras. With cameras and computers, right? Even if you don't have the full self-driving thing, they have cameras that are looking at every, this has been the case for a long time for Teslas, right? No, I mean, they've had a version of testable self-driving available for, I feel almost a decade and a point. Right, right, an incredibly long time. So compared to every other auto manufacturer, the guy at our basketball pickup game was like, yeah, I turn it on and I scroll TikToks. That's right. Which is very scary for other riders, but like that. There's a lot of Tesla users who just treat it like it is fully self-driving and it works the vast majority of the time. It does work most of the time. So the question is, and this is why for a while I was actually really bullish on Tesla and I'm not so much now, it's like, ultimately I think self-driving probably comes down to who has the most training data? Because you just need an unfathomably large amount of training data and Tesla has more than everybody else by this obscene order of magnitude. It's not just that they've had cars out for a longer time. They've had hundreds of thousands of cars out for a longer time. While Waymo has had 100, right? These are scales that are just not even in the same volume. Got one quick counterpoint again. At this point, when they tune in, right? Yeah, my understanding is that it's an arms and true. They have the most real world data from the cars. Although it's not all full self-driving data. It's not. No, no, but it's just literally visual info for the process, right? To say, what is this situation? Invidia had this project for companies other than Tesla that wanted to get a self-driving. Because they're going to handle it for them, which is the Invidia Drive Automotive Initiative, whatever. What they do is they recreate, they send out these cars. They simulate. They simulate the entire city. And then they run digitally, billions of simulations. They run, you can set it up for as many things as you want. They could have some car run in front of you, or there could be a guy run in front of you, or they just run billions of them. So you can get more training data in 10 minutes than you can get in the real world in 10 years. That's the idea. And I think that, I don't know the rate of that, but I do know that I've ridden in those cars and they worked great around San Francisco and San Jose. And so there could be something there. Which ones are those? Is that cruise? This one is just, I mean, this is an Invidia green car. Wait, literally an Invidia car. It was public. It was just you could do it at the office. Oh, I see. They were selling the technology to other companies that want to have their own self-driving kind of over the air built in. So I don't know. I don't know if that route makes more sense, but it does seem like it could get around the idea that, okay, we don't have so many cars, but we can digitally recreate this and do more training. Yes. Right now, Waymo does that. So they, you know, they tout like, oh, we have like nine million miles that have been driven by our cars, but then they do 100 million simulated. Right. So they create these digital environments and have the car digitally pretend that it's in it. And it's really a metaverse for cars, if you think about it. And in the metaverse, what if the cars wake up from the matrix and try to make it? Yeah. They really are making me extreme. Yes, a rental is like me in the major. In a GTA 5 RP server. And if it's real, kill me. I do. So I think this, this helps me understand it a lot better, like what these, like, angles of these companies are fighting for. And something that I had been thinking about a lot was, I guess maybe you're more personal perspectives on how valuable or cool you think this race to self driving technology is, because I do think it's cool at like this. I'll call it the CGP gray utopia of all automatic cars driving around that communicate with each other. And there's basically never accidents is it sounds cool. But I think on the whole, I'm a pretty anti car person. I think cars in general are like a, I blanked more of a hyperloop guy on society, less of a hyperloop guy. And I think I'm more like, you know, pro public transportation and, uh, but even as far as cars go, like there are certain frustrating aspects of it to me is like in the US. You never sat down at a Ford F-150 on the open road and just let that chopper sing. Just fucking, you know what? I have. I have a triathlon. And it's too damn big. It's have you have you guys ever looked at, uh, for example, like in the US, there's this huge, uh, if you look at sales of vehicles in the US, there's this huge spike in SUV sales, big cars, there's a longer-winded explanation behind like why that exists, especially in the US, but the amount of fatalities, like road accident fatalities has also spiked in the car. We're like, as the cars get bigger, people die. So you need a bigger car to be safer. No, everybody needs to be reminded about the prisoner's dilemma, I think. I will be driving a tank. Uh, that's what it's going to take. But that's where you go super small with the twizzler. You're going to be the wheel. You even, you even do it. You're just, you're right now twizzy making contact with an F-150 exploding. I think I, but that's, uh, like that is an example of like the, these vehicles that are, I would argue needlessly big exists primarily because of like loopholes and like regulations and laws that were meant to like save fuel economy. Uh, this, uh, cars in general force a lot of things on cities and societies that I see as a net negative. I'm not here to say that, uh, this technology around self driving cars is that necessarily. It's not that I wouldn't want this to exist. I think there's a part of me that is disappointed or sad that because something like a really well built train system doesn't have the hype behind it that gets venture capital involved and pushes legislation and has the same like hype behind it that would ultimately, uh, solve these public transport needs in the same way that you're, you're talking about like, it's not about like owning my car. It's about getting from A to B and making those situations like as convenient as possible. Um, and a specific situation I can think of is, uh, so when we went to the major together and cope and take it. I was bringing this up. You can show me. But we went to the major and, uh, Copenhagen has a pretty nice like train system that you can use to get around the city, which is nice. And we used it a bunch. And when we do, uh, that's the robot van. I don't know. It's going to flashback. But I don't think this, this is essentially the same thing. It doesn't, it doesn't make any difference. Like this is a small difference, right? It's like a, it's a, it's a, it's a big car. It's basically an Uber XL. Like that's a, or, uh, I mean, maybe I don't know. Or I mean, I could fit, but it's more like a boss. I think you feel like it. Which has, has, there's a reason for that to exist. Like I, I'm not, I'm not denying that. It's more, uh, when we left the major that night on the night of finals, there's this huge stream of people coming out of the arena that they had just built. Uh, and we all headed towards the train station. It's a massive amount of it. It's like 10,000, 15,000 people that, that walked to the train station. And within, you know, within 10 minutes, it was so easy. Everybody is on the train and out earlier last year. I went to a Dodgers game. Yeah. And I was leaving Dodgers stadiums. And I walked down to like the Uber pickup area, like where you get Uber's taxis, whatever you can get, right? And there's this massive backed up line of people waiting to like get in the cars. And even in the most idealistic version of the, uh, autonomous car paradise that we're talking about, even if you take away, all the inefficiencies of movement and they can all communicate with each other, that is a drastically shittier experience than just getting on the train and going into the scene. If you just look around, like I was thinking the same thought because when we were in Sweden, we go to the stadium right up to the stadium, housing, buildings, everything in L.A., you go to Dodgers stadium. The parking lot is as far as the up can see. Yeah. I think people don't understand how big it is. It's the, it's one of the biggest parking lots in the world. It's like, it stretches out all the rest. And this is kind of what I'm talking about is like the car, the car requires, especially even if you go, even if everybody's Tesla can drive themselves all of a sudden, the car still requires parking space and infrastructure and things that I would argue like functionally to grade cities and quality of life. And it seems disappointing to me that the amount of like effort, both like technologically and politically is going into like making cars better when even the best case scenario in like the situation I described is still shittier than the train that you can get on in Copenhagen. Like that is, I think that is unfortunate. I think the reality, like the pragmatic version of me recognizes that I might not be able to shift the political or maybe even like cultural attachment to cars and like car culture in the US. And I would rather see some sort of solution than none. This is a top 10 podcast on Spotify. Your voice here is going to change. Trains will rise up based on the words you're saying. We're going to get that California high speed rail all the way to Fresno. That's so that's part of the problem though. Is it like, isn't it shitty that that project has to deal with so much bureaucratic mess? I agree with you. It is shitty. But like it's not, I'm the anti Tesla person here, but I don't think it's Tesla's responsibility to fix car culture. No, I'm not saying that money. I'm not saying either company is responsible for fixing that. I'm saying that as an example is like we're talking about the government like a regulatory angle of why Tesla or like why Elon would want this relationship with the government so we can shift things in the direction that benefits his car company. There's no guy like that for trains. There's no, there's no, there are trains. We need a trains. Oh, yeah, it's so sick. And it sucks that this problem, a respectfully, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a jail. We give him one job. You're the train guy. You're the conductor. He looks like he can be the train guy. You're not building it. You're trying to hire a train guy. It's the F on a global train tour. I don't, it's tough. I just think as someone who maybe has been lucky enough to travel a lot and been like bend to cities all over the world. Like I, I remember going to Hong Kong as like a teenager and being like what do you mean? You can just walk everywhere and the train comes within two minutes every moment of the day and you just get wherever you want. And it's dog shit cheap, dude. What do you mean that that exists and I don't have that at home? Like that is crazy to me. At the end of the year, I remember there's like five dogs an hour that die from the sole train system. Five dogs. That's Perry pull that up. What the, what are you talking about? I'm just trying to contribute to the conversation. I haven't been to Seoul yet. So we're just making an educated guess here. Just a good guess. The proper guy. The dogs died of the train. I've been running some numbers. I'm a train's are really grainy. So we don't feel very bad. I don't, I don't mean, I'm not saying that this technological leap is not interesting to me at all. That is not what I'm saying. It's just like it feels like the system in place right now of like hype venture capital. All these things that back these sort of projects is why does it have to be directed in this direction instead of something that is demonstrably better? Well, I mean, the answer is hype and venture capital we're going to go to things that make money. Of course. The only reason you build a train which doesn't really make money is for the benefit of consumers is if your tax money came together and the government decided it was a good idea. It's never going to make as much money as there are privatized train systems going up in Florida with actual success. Yeah. We could dive into that at some point because that's a very stark contrast to California where our high speed rail system is a complete fucking disaster. Yeah. Very ironic. This story is, this story is awesome. And I don't know if there's really enough time to talk about it. Let's go for next week. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Privateized rail that's becoming really successful like up the coast from Miami. Yeah. And it's they have a successful leg and then they're growing it more. Yeah. So there is an example, but it's the whole point. It just requires governance, right? You can't you can't do this if there's a bunch of legislation stopping it. You can't do it in California. Like the amount of legislation overhead is just completely obscene to get anything built, let alone a train that goes through a million different things and any company and any construction firm and any train company, any landowner can stop it with different things. We're going to get this ship. We're going to bring him on. We're higher ranks than him. Yeah. We're don. He's actually number five. I think his new podcast number five. Number five. Oh, you did it. You did it. It's all on YouTube, but he's got us on Spotify. Um, the so it's kind of in the vein of what you were talking about. You showed that there is this long quote from like as a decline where he's talking about one of his opinions that's dramatically changed over time. And it's about regulation and about how regulation realizing that regulation is not necessarily good. It like is also the bureaucratic like there's more new. Yeah, it's like it's just a more nuanced topic than more regulation. Good less regulations. Yeah. Yeah. There's could be bad regulations or could be good. Yeah. Right. And yeah, I think that's just the thing I think about all the time when I see self-driving car news and like hype about self-driving cars. It's like, dude, this the best outcome of this situation compared to what I've experienced in other countries and cities still socks. And I think that is disappointing. All right. So Aiden's not going to be buying the self-driving dream. But let me make an argument or some of the best. So I first of I agree with you. I like, obviously, we're unique podcasts in that we have three white men giving opinions. But what does differentiate us is that I also like going to Japan. So when I got it, when I got a Tokyo, like the train system, anybody who goes to that's our hook. Yeah. One white guy who likes it. It's anybody goes to Tokyo, right? You immediately are like, holy shit, this is the greatest train system in the entire world. Oh my god. I want to live here. Bring us back to our country. Right. Right. Right. Right. So I'm fully the same boat to be clear. I would much prefer that in a world that I think happens in the next 10 to 20 years, at least in the United States, some benefits of self-driving cars. So one, I mean, first off, it's just reducing deaths. So there are 42,000 people die a year in the US from car accidents. And then 13 and a half thousand of those are DUIs and 12,000 are speeding related. So like it's not just 42,000 people die unnecessarily a year. It's, yeah. It's also a lot of those are human negligence, like the majority of them, right? And then every year around the world, 1.2 million people die a year from car accidents. That is obscene and tragic. And then you have like six million accidents a year in the US. There's $340 billion in damages. I don't think it's like the biggest driver for these types of technologies, but it is a big deal of like we're going to solve so much death and destruction and damage because once you stop human beings, it's insane that we put a bunch of humans in a driver's view. Yeah. I've been there messages. Like I think of myself as like a smart, responsible person and I'm an idiot when I check my phone and I change the music and I'm tired and I'm not paying attention. I'm like, yeah, it's just so different. We put people into death vehicles and like shoot them around the roads. It's insane. And we'll stop so much of that. Another is climate change. I think there's various studies and things to show that like electrification of vehicles broadly will decrease carbon footprint. It makes driving more efficient requires less energy, all that type of stuff. And then the economic argument is more selfish reason too. I used to commute now or each way to Nvidia. Listen, I think I don't know the math, but the amount of human misery. Yes. I think that's a very isolated, extrapolated across all people for all these commutes. It's got to be something. If you could get an extra hour of sleep in your car, you know what I'm saying? Incredible. Relax. I think that would literally make the world happier. Yes, because I, I 100, 100%. There's just a misery for 100%. If the only option, if you told me that somehow like public transportation solutions are just never going to be possible in the US, 100% because of where existing and unhypothetical situation. And this is the only way forward. It's like, of course, of course, this has so many benefits. And I agree with all of these things. Every point that you've said so far is also something that gets better with people's increased access to public transportation. Yes. No, you're right. I mean, I'm in the same boat. I don't see any path forward. There has to be such a massive change because it's like, it's not just, oh, we're building trains in LA. It's like the whole infrastructure of LA is built for cars. So I don't see a way in our lifetimes that that gets reversed personally. This comes around to a topic that I wanted to talk a little bit about, like public transportation in the US, but specifically street cars. And I don't want to, I want to enter this conversation with the idea that I do not think street cars solve a lot of the problems that exist now, especially because they exist on the street cars like 1930s. I'm just going to not even earlier than that. I couldn't believe how far back this goes. It was further back than I thought. That's solution. Street cars. Hold on. I literally just said street cars aren't the solution. America street cars are solution. I said, I heard not. I heard not. Are not the solution. Are you not? I was listening to you and like, what did you say? The, no, no, no, no, no, actually, what is a street car? I thought you were just talking about cars on a street. Oh, no. So like, like, those like trolley things. Yeah, like trolley is basically, so the way the, if you go back, if we go back in time, I'm back in time with me back into, dude, back into the mid 1800s. Big cities in the US started laying out rail and had these trolleys to get around. I saw a documentary about that called Red Dead Redemption 2. It was in, it was in San Denise. And they, and these things started off by getting pulled by horses. And then by the end of the 1800s, they started to electrify these systems. And that's where it all went wrong is what you're saying. And then they did an electric. I got you, a, we go back to the horses. But in cities like Los Angeles at the time, at the end of the 1800s, early 1900s, Los Angeles actually had the largest tramway system in the world, like the most amount of track. And what ended up happening was these systems got phased out as the automobile just became very, very popular in the US. But ultimately, it's like, if you look at pictures or stories from this period of time, this was a huge, like, infrastructural change in cities that going from the period or like the decades where this was like the dominant mode of public transportation in a lot of cities to the period of time where cars were like more favored. And I do, I think maybe not like politically or bureaucratically, but the idea that you can't make like quick, like large scale changes around public transportation. I don't really think it's true because it's even happened within the scope of our own country's history. There's been huge pivots and changes with the way public transportation works in the US. This being an example where in essentially the span of like a couple decades, these, these like street car systems disappeared. But what's your ideal? You want street cars back? You want trains back? You want horse or jeer? Horse or jeer? Horse is carrying trains? I think the reality is, I don't really care about street cars. I think as far as like space and efficiency goes even, you can make an argument that the like robo autonomous like buses basically accomplished the goal fine. I think the issue with buses as solutions and public transportation is that buses exist in the traffic that exists already. You don't solve traffic by like making buses because they just have to compete with all the cars around. But one more lane. I famously, famously, if you just build one more lane, freeze it off. I see. That's the cool. That's my solution too. I was going to say we just added a single more lane here in LA. Maybe even like two lanes like, uh, I was going to say Rick Shaw's. Just a bunch of right. Just fitness things. But carry by a horse. This new invention, you know, we go back, we go back, we get the horses, their jobs back. We'll call it a chariot. Uh, I think we'll have it pull a train. The just, I just want to push back on the idea that fundamental shifts in like public transportation infrastructure or travel infrastructure in general can happen in quicker times than we think. And I think a lot of the reason we think it's not possible is because the way we've done things has existed for so long. And in the US specifically, it feels like there's a lot of red build. That's a fair point. Public transportation network in LA. And it makes my house in the suburbs less valuable. I will kill you with a gun. In Minecraft. And that's part of the problem. The way you go. There's the, the, the nimby angle, uh, to it. There, there's so many things like that, like, uh, where I think Elon Musk is even tied into this. I, uh, I, uh, I don't know the exact details. So please correct me if I'm wrong. But if I recall when he was really hyping up the hyperloop stuff, it was part of a campaign that pushed back against the money and funding behind public transport efforts in California in killing those, uh, pushing back or killing those efforts is important to like companies he's made. And, you know, more broad, right? Broadly, we can, we can, we can look at more, uh, infamous cases of billionaires with oil money like, uh, the Koch brothers, uh, lobbying at the local level to stop public transportation projects because if public transportation succeeds in a bunch of major cities, my oil empire will start to start to crumble a little bit. Uh, it's, it's not an I, like I said, I'm pragmatic. I understand. I actually think that car culture in the US is like borderline, like, it's not in the constitution, but it's like borderline gun culture in the US. The idea of having your car hitting the open road, having the great American road trip, like, uh, the, all of these things are so embedded in the idea of American lifestyle. And I think it's, it's, it's why people get so like so defensive of like, we're going to take away your gas cars. It's like, it's almost the same level of vitriol reaction as when you talk about taking away guns. Uh, it's, it is, it is a very similar, it, it is more culturally embedded in America. And I, I'm not here to say I can overturn that. I don't think I can. That's why I want to leave. Like, I, I'm, I'm not saying it's, it's just disappointing to me that, uh, these things are, are not looked at as like the better, more idealistic solutions and that they're possible because even within our own history, they are. That's a good point. That's a good point. I, I wish I, I feel like there need to be some massive political change to do that. But you know, if we can't even build housing, it's like, you know, it's, I think it's, it's just gets into this horrific morass of lack of building in the United States. Yeah. And you're talking about like what my idealistic world is. It's like, it has so many intertwining threads with that issue as well, right? So many aspects of like housing and building to dramatically oversimplify things. The previous generation, the boomers for, you know, the 70s, like built a massive amount of stuff in our country. And now they have frozen it in amber and said, nobody should build anything. And now everybody else is fucked except them. It is. Well, make the value go up. That's worth it. Obviously, it's self incentivizing, right? It makes sense. Everything, once you own a car, everything incentivizes you to stop public development, the stop housing development to stop your car, your home goes up, your area remains more valuable. Everything is incentivizing you to not do that. And they built out the whole country and then just stopped it. And I could see something happening, but it would need like a genuine political revolution of some kind and a strategic street car reserve. And then every, and then every few years we vote on, we vote on adding another lane. You know what they don't tell you about the lane thing? What? Is that if you add enough lanes, you actually do solve it. Oh, yeah. That's it. Yes. It's the guy who does it. It's like, yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's so funny. It's like adding another lane doesn't solve traffic. But theoretically, if you have like 50 lanes, it does solve traffic. Yeah, of course. It's, nobody ever talks about that. That would actually be so sick of 50 lane highway. You could just go wherever. Just all, all, it's, of course, it'll, it'll, it'll happen in Dallas first, you know. And the whole city of Dallas is just gone. It's just a hundred lanes side by side. The only way you could justify a 50 lane highway is if the city was 50 times bigger, at which point the traffic is back. And don't even fix it. It does not fix it. Imagine forgetting your argument, I'm an emerge over 50. Do zoning out. And then fucking hard wheeling over 50 lanes, that actually be so fine. Yeah, that is sick. God, I know. You sold me 50 lane. Where do we end this whole debate is that we should make add more lanes. More lanes, more lanes, more horses. More lanes, more horses. We've done it. We said we'd solve it by the end of the day. Oh, we're going to number. For sure this week. This is how government actually works. They call it a day. I just a back pack. I'm going to go back. Everyone back, Pat, one more lane. Where do we land on Tesla? Where do you need to go? So the robots. Maybe we should. What are you going to put money in Tesla stock right now? Where are we? I can give a few more counterpoints to why Tesla has some potential legs to it. Why it has a real shot. And we can go back to that. Yeah. And so actually, it's a good segue. So the thinking, the reason that Tesla might, in quotes, be worth a hundred times with they're currently making a year, which is an, again, insane valuation. I'm not saying I agree with this. But one such thing is if they hit driverless cars, if they manage to do this, their fleet instantly becomes obscenely valuable, right? If every person has a car that can drive them and they don't even need to be in the car, that is incredibly valuable. The amount of cars they can sell go up. But every car itself becomes much more valuable because then people can use it and send it out into the world to do jobs for them like an Uber. I was going to say as soon as you do that, the people can sell the car. Tesla could buy them back and use them for a service like this. Yeah. So the way, the way to think about it is, and this is explicitly what you want to deal. This is what you want his statement. This is what you want his stated and he's never, I put it money down. I'm not buying it in cash because I'm a normal person with a normal job. I put my money down. I loan it. I send it out to do a job. It comes back damaged. Yeah. I mean, there would need to, so that's what I have to say. You've created all these problems for me as a regular person. I'm not going to, I don't want to be a taxi owner. I don't want to tax these issues. Right, and not everybody will. But if the pitch to a huge, to most people who own cars is, hey, normally we think about car ownership as you drop 20, 30, 40 thousand dollars on a car and then it immediately depreciates in value for the rest of its ownership or you buy a 20, 30 thousand dollar car and it is going to actually generate money for you over the lifetime of the car. You don't have to do that. But every day, while you're asleep or while you're at work, you can send it out. It's generating a hundred bucks on the meantime. And it's just doing this for you every single day. We always think about having to own six million DVDs in our house or whatever. Now we rent it from a service because it's become that distributed in Jeep. If you, if cars are self-driving and working everywhere, I don't want to spend 30,000 dollars to own it and then lease it out to people to make money back. I'm just going to use it at the cheap cost when I need to use it. Sure. So, so if it's that distributed. Right, right. So, I think the argument here is if they pull this off. They have millions of owners of Teslas who can suddenly start adding their thing to the fleet. And it's this incredible value as a consumer if they want to do it. Obviously, for the person who doesn't want a guy shitting in their car, they don't need to do it. But, but enough people will do it. Well, shit in your car. And I will, I will do it, right? And it comes back covered in dogs. You know, you got to hold on. Oh, this week. Yeah. Help Tesla. Right in the time. Stay right in the comments. When do you think I shit my pants during this episode? So, but so even if they even if they don't like even if every single person who owns a Tesla doesn't use it in this way, they are going to produce these like cybercaps, right, which are meant to be ubers. These things which are meant to be this is going to go out into the world and just be an Uber for everybody. So really the idea is if they pull it off, giant if they just also got Uber, right? If they take over the entire, what is the name of that industry like soft industry? The Uber lift. Oh, right, Sharon. Right, Sharon. If they, they can, if they pull this off, take all of right, Sharon immediately. Uber has a valuation of $150 billion. Right. Lift about 40 billion, right? So, it's a 150 plus 40 plus Tesla. That's $900 billion. Billy and dollars. Even if they had entire Uber, entire lift, what's their current valuation, real estate valuation of like 84? I have a, they're not even close to what they're worth now. Okay. I'm going to give it two more. I have a dark question at the end of this. Okay. I'll, I'll keep it somewhat concise. The other two points, one is Optimus. So they have this robot. If we pull it up here, they have this humanoid robot that they supposedly are going to release. I sure, you know, he says like every year it's going to come out. It, who knows if it'll ever come out. If it does, then that is going to be this unbelievable amount of, of units that they can sell because every company, every home could have these helping out. Now, you might be like, ah, that's pie in the sky. They can make a robot and that's probably correct. But part of what, for example, Andre Carpathi has said, who did the Tesla, who led the Tesla, ah, ah, AI stuff is again, it comes back to this data. If they have, Tesla has the amount of data that can fill an ocean and Waymo and everybody else has a swimming pool of data, right? The scale is that different. What Andre said is that there is actually a lot of translation from car vision processing over to robotics processing that it's actually very similar of how you manage self-driving and process all that visual information to having a physical robot that's moving through your house. I don't know enough about robotics to know if that's true. It's probably oversimplifying things. But in theory, that gives them this massive advantage. Again, over the Boston Dynamics who make this funny prototype that they show once a year, these guys actually have an insane amount of data to work on. Okay, well, how much money paying for that today? Like, how much of this show that makes me trust that's coming out relatively soon will work, will sell to consumers, will make a profit, will make it, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, editor, cut this from the episode. I don't believe that the robot thing will work. This seems way too optimistic. I don't know. It's optimistic, if you will. Hey, I'm moving over. Oh, I'm moving over. Yeah. Okay, and then last thing, and we can conclude the whole argument, is battery storage. So it's easy to think of Tesla just as a car company, but they do a ton of work with batteries. So their growth, actually, I have an article here, the growth that they've had with batteries is insane. Yeah, yeah. I've seen a little bit about this. So you can, you can see this. They've had 2024 figures represent a 214% leap in storage deployment. So Tesla is leading the market globally in selling batteries and power packs and storage solutions. And this is only going to grow a little bit like the guy who sold pans to the gold miners and the gold rush, like all the other EVs don't have this kind of power management system and technology and deployment, right? So in theory, just in the same way, the Tesla's super chargers are the de facto chargers across the nation, right? They can also be, and quite possibly will, yeah, okay, if Ford comes in and releases an amazing EV, that's great. But they're almost certainly going to be using Tesla's batteries, their system, their charging network. And that is almost going to be as valuable or more valuable because the amount of energy that is going to be needed and used, and even within AI, like battery technology, this is going to become a massive industry is and is going to keep growing estimates that it's going to grow like, I don't know, like 900% or something crazy. I forget the exact number over the next like eight years, but batteries storage, the idea that in the future as we unlock more types of energy generation that there's systems that are like, we're selling energy to each other that people, again, like the Tesla thing, you can have solar panels in your house and you sell the extra energy onto the market. And this becomes a real value ad for people with Tesla taking a piece of every single thing. It's another one of those like, if this lands and they can deploy it to everybody and get there, crazy valuable, a massive if though. And that is the argument for why Tesla might be worth a hundred times. What a base. I appreciate you giving it to me and I like hearing it and, and I, again, I don't know, right? I don't know. Can I admit something? Yeah. All right, this is not a joke. 10 minutes before we recorded this, I sold half of my Tesla stock. I bought a bunch. I love that. I bought a lot of few years ago because of the full self driving thing and I am now not nearly as confident that they're going to succeed it. Yeah, literally looking into all this made me sell my Tesla stock. That's fun. That's crazy. I think there's an argument for all this, but I, I wouldn't go all the way on it. You would have killed a model you had, dude. Can I, say, I this up. So you're not the only one. I, this might take a sort of pull up, but you, yeah, here it is. You're not the only one doing what you just did. So is Elon Musk's, it's all the executives, right? CFO. I think I got it. Wow. Elon is selling. I mean, a big sense he always saw the price is like, well, the stock. Well, so, okay, the stock was ridiculously highly valued. So just for, for recap of people, people are saying Tesla's crashing just to give a sentiment. Tesla was obscenely highly valued. What like, let's say six months ago, then they became double, obscenely valued. And now they're back to obscenely overvalued. That's right. We're still talking right now after the crash. They are obscenely overvalued. You got the Tesla chair selling, you got the CFO selling, you got Kimball Musk selling. I did this thing where I looked at Nvidia insider sales. They've got, you know, 1.4 million buys, 2.8 million sales. Most companies will have more sales than buys insider because people get paid in stock and they went off. Yeah. Tesla zero buys. There's not a single Tesla insider buying shares. Everyone is selling. What's the time range on that? There's like three months and 12 months. Over three months, nobody bought. Now, I think a regular level employee doesn't get included, but anyone who's like a senior level employee gets counted for this. Yeah. Nobody bought. Over three months or 12 months. They're only selling. I think they also understand how much hopeium is paked into the stock price that that's my argument. Yeah. Like what I've been describing is all these moonshots of like if they pull off full self driving with just vision, that's crazy. The unbelievable achievement opens up so much. If they, the batteries keep growing at the rate. If optimist robots are what they're talking about. And then if all of those things land, maybe it's worth its current valuation. Like that's crazy. Yeah. I don't get why it's 100x right now. And then particularly a few years ago, the argument I made earlier of they have so much more data than everybody else gives them an obscenely huge advantage when it comes to training, the AIs and the systems that are going to achieve full self driving. I still think that's true, but that advantage is diminishing so rapidly that I don't know it like right now with what's going on in China. I was trying to. I was trying to. I'm trying to. I'm trying to. I'm trying to. I'm trying to. So they don't fear any big buzz that already came to low-ooooo car racing, they just didn't like the answer. I badge a little bit. I do etc. It's difficult, you insist on not using a car. That reallyS Í±∏ÔøΩ. It admit in the front door, you know, you know, there's a for China, so they've planned for certain Chinese things. Like for example, that China has all these bus and bike lanes with different lines that Tesla can't adapt to with their current method. So this guy, they rolled out FSD and Tesla recently February this year. This guy in China tries it, he immediately gets seven tickets in the first ride because it keeps veering into these camera checked bus lanes and out and he gets ticket. He gets ticket. This is fall fixable. What I'm saying is like B-Y-D is building for their consumer. They know what they have to do. Yeah. Ficycle pad. No, no, no, no. He's nervous. And so again, that makes me worried about their ability to compete in the second biggest market or actually probably the biggest market. Right. I don't see how they win in China for a variety of reasons. And then around the world, the Chinese EVs are going to catch up so hard. It's like what you said with Mexico. If China can come in and offer a cheaper EV. There wasn't a tariff. I mean, it would be buying them here. Yeah. And so really the Chinese EV manufacturers, that's what's making me go, I don't see the advantage anymore to the same degree. I still think it's incredibly... Tesla has amazing products. Everybody I know has one. Loves it. It's great cars. The driving stuff is incredible. But I'm not seeing this advantage that'll let them exclusively hit this point of technology before everybody else. And it could happen. It'd be dope if it did. And then the last thing I want to say, because we didn't talk about it much because I don't think it's important in the relevant discussion. I don't want to make it too political. So there is a part of it where I'm just, I personally, I think a lot of people are souring on the brand because of Elon Musk's personal antics. So the point where if there was a comparable thing from someone else or even a slightly worse thing, I might pick that. Like I want to buy an EV soon. I'm not going to buy Tesla, probably because of this reason. And I think that alone makes it a harder sell as a business when you're... You know what I'm saying? Yeah, it does. I would be scared to be a Bud Light investor during their controversy because the sales went down. I'm just going to say, you know what I'm saying? So that's a big part of it for me too. It's like I just feel like there's so much risk baked in, so I don't want to do it. Speaking of things that have possibly controversial brands, Pokemon go sweet, say, love. What? What we've all been waiting for? Wait, no, no, that is not a good enough segue. Okay. Segway is from... You need to find a connection from... You're ending the conversation. You got to go from Elon Musk, Tarnishing the Tesla brand into Saudi and Pokemon in an organic way. Musk needed buyers for a new venture where he was buying Tesla. He needed money to borrow for loans. Where did he go? The Saudi Royal Wealth Fund. They are the biggest purchaser other than Elon Musk of the Twitter buyout. They're also buying something new lately. Pokemon go! That's great. That's great. I'm moving to your side. That was amazing. Uh, Pokemon go, Niantic, is being sold to the Saudi Foreign Wealth Fund for three points. Actually, being sold to a gaming company owned by a Saudi Wealth Fund for a $3.5 billion dollars. What are your thoughts on that, gentlemen? The sports washing continues. Just buying the next major e-sport. Uh, dude, I think it's so... Honey, I mean, my first reaction was why? Because, uh, like, is Pokemon go? Is it just really successful and profitable? I heard it makes good money. Uh, here's also, I got a little background. So Saudi Royal Wealth Fund, they buy everything. You guys, I mean, they spent money on sports teams, on everything. E-sport, everything. They've done tons of purchases. Does this, like, real quick? Is this, like, a government entity that buys all this stuff? Yes. And it's, okay. So it's public. You're not public, but it's government-owned. Yeah, it's essentially government. It's public money. It's like, they have this extra money from oil. Yeah, I mean, they bought ESL, the company, who's working. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, the worker. Right, and I'm like, and I don't really know what's going on there. I just know all my friends who work in e-sports are now like, yeah, I got this offer to go work in Qatar for the World Series. I'm like, okay, that's cool. But it's all in the Middle East now. So that's the idea. They're making moves, dude. They body ESL, they killed Jamal Kishoggi. Yeah. They fucking keep it real over there. They shot him and they walked away and they said, just good business. They have all this extra oil money and they want to invest in things that are like, future buzzwords, basically, whether it's EVs, whether it's e-sports, whatever. They want to have flashy, cool things that are, so when the oil money runs out, they've got all this business. That's the idea. And so they've been buying gaming companies. One thing, they bought the company that made monopoly go and it turns out that made them. I mean, I don't know if you guys know monopoly go. It's not like monopoly at all. It just looks like monopoly, but it's like the greatest money extract your game of all time. Like, it just, it's got all the loot boxes and puzzles and everything and they've been printing. That game is like one of those profitable games ever. Yeah, I worked in mobile games at EA, which is a beloved category. Yeah, mobile games. Oh, carefully. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So as the resident Elon Musk fan, I worked at EA on mobile games. You're like the Winston and Overwatch for the comments. Yeah, yeah. It's awesome. I literally was there when it was voted worst company in America. All right. And in the article for that, they said it's mostly because of Doug. Yeah. No, not like not a joke and I did. And obviously I left. But so like mid rate, this is a decade ago. Mid range mobile games make like a million a day. If you're talking like isn't it crazy? That's mid range. You're talking about class of plans. You're talking about tens of millions. And that's a day. Yeah. And then it did. Well, that's when they do a big drop. Like, for example, Fortnite, you can make 50 to 150 million on a new skin. Yeah. Like when Fortnite was at its peak. So the numbers that you can get off microchans actions in mobile games are genuine. And you will see and they cost no. Nobody should be fine digital items in many games. You own so many CS go knives. It's crazy. It's your grandchildren will starve. You're a rich monster and your grandchildren will starve because if you're a shelter, you can sell them to the Southeast. Look at it. Look at the butterfly knife. It spins. It's blue. It's pretty blue. It's not fully blue. I'm a they didn't on this. I didn't. Dude, I did not read. I mean, I understood that mobile gaming in general is like the biggest chunk of the gaming market revenue wise. That is still wild to here. Yeah. I think the idea of I was thinking earlier about what you first brought up the topic of people like the line in Saudi Arabia finally gets built and you're playing Pokemon go in the line. And you're just you and your friends walking down one fucking long hallway. Catch it Pokemon. You never turn left. There's another line. Is it five? Somebody's like, oh, guys, it's a charizard and it's at the end of the line. Like there's only one. You got to go the other line. 500 miles. It's it's. It's. It's just yeah, I think the passing headline makes you think is is my initial reaction. It's like, why would you why would you do this? But there's a larger cohesive strategy surely around this amount of money being spent. Is that what I'd like to think? I can wildly speculate. Yeah. Sometimes it feels like, you know, the rate at which my familiarity with esports in particular makes me feel a little doubtful of like my own take in the sense that they feels like they've overpaid for a lot of things. Like you don't have to bring this level of spending to esports. It is highly irrational. Yes. Get a lot of the hold that they wanted in the industry. And to a degree, I can kind of it feels like a flexing on like a geopolitical scale. Yeah, it does feel like flexing. You know, it feels like is this worth three and a half billion? Pokemon goes down from its peak. The people that are using it said if they changed macro transactions, I'm going. Now that people always say that you don't know. But like if they try to make it poke on fans are not leaving. Sorry. Like, no, they've been abused for decades. They're not people and they're not going to go away. Yes. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what I mean, but there's definitely a lot of pushback and like anger and fear from the community of like from the Pokemon go community because they don't want to change anything. They want everything to be they're they're they do it all the time. They've been doing it for years and years and years. Yeah, they're worried about change. What they said in the article was that they're focusing basically on AI and I need to look more into it when you do this in the future. One thing I'd want to talk about, uh, speculate, poke on go AI. Well, okay. I will speculate based on what I've read about AI gaming. So there's a there's a push from some major companies, Microsoft being the biggest recently who announced they have this new AI generative game that is trained on one of their games. And they're going to start using the Microsoft library to work on generative AI video games. I think this is incredibly far off in the future. I don't have a lot of faith that that would have I'm pretty pro AI and I have a very, very hard time seeing any of that ever manifesting in a way that people want to play or buy at all, but that is at least an explicit push. So in theory, what these guys are doing is saying we're dropping their traditional video games and they said this in the article like they are focusing more on AI tech and AI games. So they're like Pokemon go. That's great. That's human beings making things that other humans being are enjoy. We're going to make a bunch of AI game slop that nobody enjoys. And if you believe that, you know, that's like that's what they think is the future and or at least you know the big moonshot opportunity and that's what they're going for. I'm actually curious because in a weird, you know, weird change of pace on the yard bonus episode this week, which you list to a patreon.com. So you are. Are we doing it? No. No, we talked about something of the little more serious. We talked about vibe coding. Yeah. And the way people are before talked about vibe coding. Three of us. Ludwig was gone. Three non coders talked about vibe code. Well, we were, can you give me like a one-cented summary? I would love to hear what kind of breakthroughs you guys came to. I don't know if I would have to say about vibe coding. What are the, I think it would be, it was actually a huge chunk of the episode. It would be unfair. I'd just need a tear deride. Yeah, yeah. You just have to go to the patreon. I want to ask you what you guys think of it because I had not heard of this until I think Nick brought it up. This idea of vibe coding where you use chat GPT to spit out code that you don't know how to write and you build a game like that. And then you just iterate on the game by using chat GPT prompts. And apparently these games are starting, you know, you could turn around a project in a relatively short period of time. And then people are launching these games on like mobile and then filling them with advertisements and then making money. And it's like a, and it's a trend. And I thought there's really interesting because my two reactions were on one hand. I was like, oh man, this really like cheapens this art form and makes it, this feels a little like soulless. And then on the other hand, I was like, well, if you can provide a tool to people to create their ideas without being inhibited by being unable to learn how to code for whatever reason. And then I thought, do you know, what is good and bad about this? And that's basically what we talked about for like 20, 30 minutes. And if I'm called, just bump us down to number 10. Fuck. Tucker's carving his way back. It was Tucker, if you believe me, he knew what he was doing. So I always wanted your, because I feel like it's in the vein of this conversation of like something like AI just pumping out video games automatically. This is sort of similar to that. It's like still a prompt, still a human idea. But somebody sitting at a computer and making games in a very different way and potentially sacrificing some of what they have in their mind because they aren't able to meticulously edit and understand the code. Yeah. Here, can I get the tall straighter? Yeah. You can kick it off. I mean, look, my answer to this, I'm not a coder. So I haven't tried vibe coding. I don't know the difference. And what the, but you're, my understanding is that the games that have been made so far are pretty slop. Yeah. One of them I know made it. It was like an MMO flying game. This guy, he, Harry made, I don't know, he has a big audience. Dude, he made it. It made a lot of money. It was making like a hundred K a week or something. It was like, it was a printing money. And it was like, I tried it. It was really sloppy. But it was like, you know, a kid could play. You're playing a game of money. So there could be potential there. Right now, as a gamer, I see such a drastic goal between, I mean, it just has, there's so many issues and edge cases that come up that you don't get fixed that I think it's kind of crap. I would during the segment where we were recording zipper tried to make a game, uh, all using chat GBT and he successfully made a tiny game where you control a profile picture of me that eats hamburgers, which were yellow dots. And every time you fed it a hamburger, the score went up by a million. And so in within the span of us having the conversation, that was crafted. Yes. So they made red dead religion too. Yes. So vibe coding. This was coined recently by Andre Carpathi actually who is the leader of Tesla. And so basically it's what you're saying. It's just letting AI do all the coding. And that's been the slow transition that everybody's going through over the past two years since chat GBT came out. So for people are not programmers, every programmer now, asterisk, almost every single programmer is using AI extensively. And it's so unbelievably helpful for so many tasks. And that doesn't mean that the entire project is done by AI. It means that you are figuring out the outline. You're deciding what things to do. And then you say, okay, now that this is defined, AI, can you do this for me? So you are building the structure you're thinking through what it is. But then you're directing the AI like you would a junior engineer at a software company. And you're saying, okay, now go through the logistics of making this work. And you still then, like a senior engineer, would review what they're doing. And because there's going to be problems, there's going to be lots of issues, you have to review things. It doesn't always work. But that's the idea and it saves a lot of time. I do this all the time. With vibe coding, it's getting to a point now where you do not need to ever code or review code. So that ratio of like, oh, it's helping you as an assistant with all these things is becoming like a hundred percent as opposed to, you know, it's 50 percent of the code or something like that. So with regards to games specifically, I guess to summarize that, AI is getting good enough to do this now. And it's improving rapidly every few weeks. There's a new model which is even better programming. So this is very much a thing that is happening. So I think that what Microsoft is largely arguing for is the idea that an AI itself is basically going to generate the game, right, that you were playing. So it's AI's directing AI's to make things and a whole bunch of just AI's basically doing it all. And that's the thinking is, you know, they can go release this into the wild and then people are just playing these infinitely generated AI games. Vibocating is more of a human who is then directing AI's, right? So with Vibocating, like you as a human in the case that you were talking about are still directing what the app or game is, right? With zippers case, like he's deciding the design of the game. The AI isn't doing that. He wants me to eat the cheeseburger. I want you to eat the cheeseburger. And so this is where I think a lot of AI development is going to go and why I'm generally optimistic about it. I think there's a lot of examples like I have people in my point, Crow and failboat. I love them. Horrible programming. Truly awful. And both of them have started to really add cool sophisticated stuff into their streams that use programming because AI helps them do it. And so I think this case of like humans directing AI's to do their ideas. They are the creative director and the AI does the grunt work. That's where it's largely going to work. And if a guy comes up with a cool weird mobile game that people are like, oh, this is dumb. This shouldn't be making that much. Well, that's what we thought about Flappy Bird, right? Oh, I totally agree. I mean, you know, you don't get to decide what's worth it or nothing. People are right decided by playing it. Whatever's fun. They'll play. And this is obviously is a good. Huge conversation. We'll dive into it in the future. But the core distinction being like fully AI generated stuff where no human is involved versus you are a creative director and AI is a tool just like Photoshop or like OBS or like playing a video game, right? And you are directing what is happening. That I think is good and legitimate. I definitely I want to dive into this a little more on some of the questions around it in a future episode. Oh, and episode two of Lemonade Stan. I think something we all liked about the last episode that we were hoping for is we got a ton of thoughts from people in the comments about pretty much every topic that we discussed, which I really, really liked. The plan in the future, I think if you have anything to add to a topic that we're talking about, if you have a correction about something that we're talking about, these long-winded explanations or comments that people are giving are really, really great. And we want to make sure that we include good feedback into the show in a way in the future. So I think we haven't quite figured out the exact way we want to segment it into the show yet, but keep providing that because follow ups and including your guys' conversations in the show somehow going forward is something that we all really want. I'm going to read every single comment about Doug wanting to take your jobs. What are the top of any of these? You want to take your jobs and give them to Elon Musk. Yeah, no, the comment quality has been really good. I don't know how to respond to all of them. I've seen so many thoughtful comments. So it's stuff where we are reading and then I think meaningfully want to actually incorporate into what we're doing in some way. Unless you're commenting on Spotify, in which case, honestly, I didn't know that existed a week ago and I'm not really reading those very often. \\n\\nI pull out a gun and I start pointing at you guys. So I'm going to shoot you, right? And H.O.K. You say, Hey, please don't shoot me, right? Please don't. I'll do whatever you want. And Aiden pulls out his own gun and says, I'll shoot you back if you shoot me. Don't fucking do that. And I put the gun away and I say, that was a test. Aiden, you're not a good friend. I'm only hanging out with all the economic turmoil going on. I have decided to invest in a secure asset. Finally, which one? Which one? Barcoine track, you can probably guess. I would say fart coin. It's a stable reserve. No, no, older than that. Oh, um, come coin. Older than that. I want to. What do you want me to reach for? Light coin theory. No, no, no, older. You're investing in rockets. Needs my brain before 2009. That's right. I went on eBay and I purchased a real 1776 Spanish gold de balloon. Oh, no. In its entirety right here, ladies and gentlemen, I am ready. Now it is a little bit smaller than I expected. Ladies and gentlemen, my nest egg. Is it really? Is that really a gold Spanish de balloon? It's about 250 years old. Dude, a pilot gave their life to try and get this. $600 and this is my hedge against tariffs. You're in the gold club. I'm so excited. I have you. And what's cool is I bought this from Spain before the tariffs. I didn't have to pay. You're playing world markets like a fiddle. Gonna be honest. Not smaller than I thought. This is real. This is real. It's so much smaller than I expected. I'm hiding my whole life. I thought like I was like pirated with the caravans. It's like barely. I can't even. It's smaller than a dime. It's minuscule. So how much is this actually worth? $660. Are you serious? I thought it would be bigger. It just runs out. That's kind of nuts. What kind of topic are we talking about today? Well, I, unlike Doug, chose to buy another CSGO skin this week. So we'll see how that pays out. But today we'll be talking about the ongoing, not that many changes, not many pieces of news about the ongoing trade war with China. No, any news at all. tariffs around the world, especially those with China that we are not only keeping, but expanding in contrast to last week, Doug talking about overbuilding and how building too much could be bad in the context of China. And also I may or may not be revisiting the reason that we're getting a Korean child in this area. We are going to get, you got the blue and you get a Korean child. And I'll get a part of this. Are these iron estates? Yeah. The hedge against tariffs is in Korean baby. It is. It holds and dreams into this Korean child. Yeah. I think it's going to pay it out. Once he starts winning StarCraft tournaments, it'll pay off. He's going to get really into brood war and win those like $1,000 daily. That's the ones they have. I have been getting really into brood war. It's sick. It's honestly sick. There is no money in it. OK, well, obviously if you're coming from last episode, you may have noticed that even within the span of us recording that episode, things change. When we recorded it that day, we didn't have the calculation for how the global tariffs that were listed were actually made. So I wanted Hriok to briefly explain that and just make a correction on what we were talking about last week. And also, if you want to just jump into how things have changed in the past week, it was so much sillier than I thought it was. What else? I mean, for context, what he announced it like an hour, two hours before we recorded it last week. Yeah, the same thing happened today. He has done another supposedly 40 chess move today, which we are now. We're actually pretty lucky. I think where I am super glad that Trump is making these big announcements on Wednesday morning. So this is real journalists. Yeah. Because if he announced them on Thursday, everything we say would be completely out of date. The tariff calculation, we came out with the big board in the Rose Garden and said, this is what they charge us. It turns out that was a mathematical calculation based on basically imports minus exports divided by imports. It just basically said, if we buy more of their stuff than they buy of us, and that counts as them charging us a tariff, that's what they did. They used that number, which is again, I think, made up to charge them a reciprocal tariff. But a lot has happened since then, and we're in a fucking different world. So as of today, you know, I say up until yesterday, markets were reacting horrendously. Purendestly. The stocks were plummeting. We're having red day after red day. There was one day where it started green. Everyone said, oh, what recession. It went red by the end of the day. And they were all, you know, so it's been bad. And you might have mentioned this off-pot or on-pot, but one of the theories that has been espoused as to a reason why we might want these tariffs is that if the stock market is crashing, it is going to push everyone to buy us bonds. We're going to go buy us bonds. And when you buy them, it drives down our cost of borrowing so that we can refinance our many trillions of debt. That was one of the ideas espoused by Scott Besson. Well, in the last few days, the opposite was happening. Our cost of borrowing was ramping up. It was getting more expensive. And it was largely because countries were dumping their US treasuries. Japan was a major one. They were dumping them. So we were getting a rising US long bond and we were getting a crashing stock market, which is the worst of both worlds. So I don't know if this is 40 chess. I don't know what happened, but today there was a big pivot because both those things were happening at once yesterday. We tariff on any country that didn't retaliate is paused, except for a universal 10% tariff that is still staying on everyone. So everybody still has the 10%. Everybody still has a 10%. But if you didn't retaliate, if you're like Vietnam or something and you didn't retaliate, then we're getting rid of the 43 and it goes back down to 10. Market rebounding. Yes. Switch tariff lifted. Yes. What recession. Yeah. That's true. It's day in like, I don't know 60 years, it had a massive single green day and Vietnam has down to a 10%. So a lot of things that like Twitch see were coming. But overall, still a 10% compared to the old world. Before all this, 10% everybody and China, which did retaliate, the war is now begun. The trade war has now begun. It was a, I'll give you a quick brief timeline. We announced Rose Garden 34% tariff on China. And it goes, no, this is bullying. Whatever they said, fuck you. They announced 34% back. Problem says big mistake, buddy. And that was an extra 50% on top of that total 104. Then today, when he like, removed everybody else, he added more. So now we're at like just a couple hours ago, bringing the total to 125%, which when I someone saw someone mention this in a message, I thought they were joking. Yeah. As we dove into last week, you know, a direct personal business investment in how this Chinese tariff specifically shakes out in the next few months. And I had a quick question for you because one thought, I was trying to like put into layman's terms, basic questions that I could ask you this week about kind of why this is going on. 125 to me, knowing that something like Chinese EVs already had 100% tariff on them before all this. And that's like a big part. The main reason why Chinese EVs can't be sold in the US. What is the point of raising something from 104 to 125? Aren't we already at a point where there's basically no reason to raise that? I don't understand. What I will say is a 125% tariff is essentially a total trade decoupling that is like no good can really be sold profitably at 125% markup. And is 104 not that already? You know, for some small goods, I think China is so much better at manufacturing, like, you know, making certain nuts, bolts, what, certain thing that we have no factory comparable. So yeah, there is no alternative than, yeah, they'll still pay it for certain things. Yeah. Exactly. So it is a troll. I mean, the number is astronomical. We have basically means total trade decoupling from us in China. And the only real big question that wasn't answered today, I just want to get this where we go back to China, is the EU did retaliate. So the EU before today's announcement did like a 25% counter-tariff back on America. And then today we're like, our allies are good. God is good. We're back only on focusing on China. And someone reeled out the question, what about the EU? And they ignored it. So I don't know exactly. I don't know where we stand on that because EU is our massive trading part of one of our biggest and the second biggest economy block. I don't know where we're standing on that because they said if you retaliated, we're keeping the tariff. So I don't know. That's the one that I will know by tomorrow, maybe we don't know now. Before I jump into my villain chair questions that I have this week, my first thought when I saw this was, wow, more immediate inconsistency. This does nothing to fix the concerns around uncertainty. We just hit a 90 day pause on these tariffs for the majority of the countries that they were set on. This feels similar to the back and forth that was happening with Canada and Mexico at the beginning of the year. And because it changes so frequently, it doesn't really give me any, removing the China factor from the situation and just thinking about this as in a global sense. This doesn't really do anything for me personally. Yeah, I mean, I saw it. I saw it. I can't imagine a being the guy with a bunch of capital to make the investments in factories in America or wanting to make investments abroad and this being that comforting. Yeah, I saw a great joke that was like, you know, the guy who started a factory in America yesterday is pretty stupid. Right? The guy who saw these 40% tariffs and it's like, oh, I'll move to America. No one was actually doing that. But the idea, the argument that this is going to bring factory jobs from all these different countries to America seems pretty foolish. The mug mug factory was getting Bill already. Yeah, we were moving it. We were moving it off mugs in America. Finally, we can bring those jobs back. The thing is, it may happen with China. I mean, this China thing is the real thing because they can't sell in America now directly. I don't know what it's a new world order. I think he hadn't mentioned it last week too. Something interesting that I saw was they lifted the exception rule to where you could avoid tariffs by ordering directly from China for things valued under $800, which is how companies like TeamU and I think Wish made basically their entire business model was based off of that existing. Now that exception is gone. Yeah, I had a chatter who I think works at the North American branch of Xi'an and he talked to his boss and they were like, yeah, I mean, if this doesn't get figured out, we're fine. There's no way to do that properly. Everything is 100% more expensive. So I don't know. I think it's a good time actually to just jump into this. I want to do a show that Scott Besson. Oh, yeah, you can show that. So that's the thing that's going on. Yeah. So Scott Besson, as far as I can tell, if you guys have heard others, there's like three main players in the Trump administration who are advocating for tariffs, essentially everyone else, including all the people on the right, hate them. There is Scott Besson who's the Secretary of Treasury. There is Howard Locke. We hit his name. Yeah, I can. Okay. Howard Locke. He's the Commerce Secretary. And then there is Peter Navarro who's a senior advisor to the White House. So Howard Locke, having watched a little more of his stuff, seems to be a height man with no substance. Yeah, I was trying to maybe give the benefit of the doubt. He just, any question he's asked about tariffs, he's just like, American people are going to be so stoked. And it's like, no, that's not what we were asking. He also, I agree. He specifically said, and this is the first person to come to Secretary do this. He said to camera, you should buy Tesla. It's under a value. He's, he's had a specific stock you should buy. And it's down from there. So like, you can't do that. You can't pick and choose as a Commerce Secretary specific stocks to pump. Peter Navarro is advocating a whole bunch for tariffs. He supposedly is like the big guy that is convincing Trump about the value of tariffs. And I listened to an interview with him on a CBS, I believe. And then again, it doesn't really answer the questions. And he has this belief when asked about how long it would take manufacturers to move factories to America. He's like, I don't want to hear about it during COVID. We got things set up in two months. It's not going to take years. So he has this belief that like America can re, like, remanufacture factories in a couple of months if we wanted to. He also, Peter Navarro has over half a dozen books where he quoted an economist named Ron Vara to make up a justification for some of his beliefs. Ron Vara is his last name rearranged. It's made up. He made up this person. This has been exposed. He has made up a source that's himself. So again, I'm not too out of the three. I don't want to put if you can just stop. What's it? What's a face mode? No, that's a face mode. That's some hearing potter Voldemort. He's the chamber of secrets whipping up the reasons for why for why this is actually. And then and then Trump found his journal and has been reading from it. Learning about it. Yeah, he's been talking to the bathroom. That's the lonely Trump finally found Navarro's journal. Yeah, Peter Navarro. He recently has been saying that car manufacturers are just assembly lines here in the US. And they need to start making everything here. And he talks about how Elon has been advocating against tariffs and saying there should be free trade. He's been pushing back. Navarro has gotten into a tip and said, well, Elon is a car guy and they should be manufacturing everything here in America. This so upset Elon who to Tesla's credit, they do make most stuff in America. They're fairly integrated here. Is now recalling Peter Navarro publicly on Twitter. Peter retardo. Yes. And so that's the new he's now using like Trump, Eskian slurs against the people in the cabinet. So there's this strange kind of fracturing happening. It's a big fracture. Yeah, it's very, very strange. It is so awesome to watch two high level government officials act like the people in my CS solo queue game. Yeah. Yeah. I don't maybe it's not awesome. Maybe Elon should have covered B site. As I'm going to say. Yeah. Yeah. So however, we do have an offer here. His name is Scott Besson. So I'll stop as in Secretary of Treasury. He, I, you know, a truck, please elaborate more. I would say I like Scott Besson of all the options that could have been picked. I think he's a reasonable smart guy. I think he's got a background in what he's talking about. I read his stuff before he ever was part of the administration and thought he had. It is funny though, because when I read his stuff, he used to be like, yeah, tariffs are pretty fucking stupid. And that is an administration. I think he has to totally line. But he might be like, I don't know, an operative on the inside. He's like trying to, he has to cozy up the Trumpets and the nice things, but he's like trying to get reason to what we're doing. And so this is his statement. Yeah. So he, he last week was advocating for everything about how tariffs are great. How this is good. He was advocating how if we bring the bond yield down, that's going to allow us to refinance debt and save a whole bunch of money on the debt, which didn't happen. Just to be clear. Yeah, what should have happened if you pull this up Perry. So this is him after, after a stray week, right, of talking about how tariffs are brilliant. This is Trump's plan. We're going to do this. Here's the video. And all this was again, this was driven by the president of strategy. He and I had a long talk on Sunday. And this was his strategy all along. And that you know, you might even say that he got in China into a bad position. They, they responded. They have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actors. Damn. Okay. Go, go, go. There's a little bit more. Yeah. Yeah. And we are willing to cooperate with our allies. The allies are bringing the border. Who did not retaliate. It wasn't a hard message. It's like, dude, if, if like we were hanging out, right? Yeah. At like a basketball court, whatever. And then, and then I pull out a gun and I start pointing at you guys. So I'm going to shoot you, right? And H.O.K. You say, hey, please don't shoot me, right? Please don't. I'll do whatever you want. And Aiden pulls out his own gun and says, I'll shoot you back if you shoot me. Don't fucking do that. And I put the gun away and I say, that was a test. Aiden, you're not a good friend. I'm only hanging out. That is a perfect example. I'm only hanging out with H.O.K. from that one. He's my ally. Yeah. He's my ally. And in, in, in, in this case, if, if we were following this with the EU example, H.O.K. also pulled a gun out. Yeah. Yeah. You're so friends with him. Yeah. No, it's crazy because I, again, I'm talking to this before and I want to do a little presentation about why possibly coordinated tariffs on China make, make sense. There could be a reason for it. With the idea that this was all a master plan to get us and our allies, no, we want allies. We pissed off everybody. I got a video, we were maybe able to pull up of like the Australian PM. Australia buys more of our stuff than the we do up there. They're not even, even in the weird formula they used, Australia is our friend. We still put 10% on them. They have, there's Singapore same thing. All their leaders are like, this sucks. This is where, we're mad at you. And that's supposed to be our allies that we let off the hook. It's crazy. I mean, there's nobody in any country that's like more friendly to us. We still have longstanding relationships that haven't totally dissolved that would consort the allies here. Again, I, I can see the, the rationale behind a China tariff. I think this is like a last ditch. Oh, shit. Everything was breaking because again, when the stocks are down and the bond yields are up. And I want to explain that right now because you asked for a little bit more of a clarification. I think when people say the word bond, people's eyes start to glaze over. And when you say bond yield, people's eyes roll back in their head. Yeah. I think this is a good thing to explain like in general, because I think a lot of people don't know about this stuff to begin with. And then for me, specifically like my main interaction with this stuff is I, you know, I bought some treasury bonds last year. So how, how does this work? At one point you had a portfolio of 50% treasury bonds, been recently us go knives. Yeah, the most responsible portfolio. And guess what? That portfolio right now would be holding up. That's true. Like you and Warren Buffett have the same strategy. Okay. So quick, quick primer. If you're a rich person or a pension fund or a government, someone with a lot of fucking money, I'm cursing a lot today. You could pick a lot of things to invest in because you don't want to hold it in cash. Right. And stocks, you can put it in bonds, you can put it in goalie, but it really doesn't. And what bonds is essentially IOUs from governments, they pay you back. Okay. A lot of time, especially lately, people have been putting their money in a stocks because they've been going up. They've had so many good years. A lot of money to win stocks. But the idea is based on historical patterns, when stocks have a bad period when they're crashing, when they're down, people flee to safety. So they go to things like real estate gold bonds. And bonds has always been the bigger one of the three. And correct me wrong. Things generally are going to be lower yield, but it's lower risk. Right. If you just want safe money, that's pretty much guaranteed. That's where you go to, but stocks is the higher return. Exactly. You bonds are guaranteed. So if you buy IOU from the government, if you're America and you're like, can I borrow $100 million and I give it to you, you offer me a guaranteed war percent. And historically, I think the idea is that American bonds are the most, are the best thing you could be putting your money in because the dollars, the reserve currency, it has the US government behind it. It's basically a guaranteed return with no risk, whatever that return happens to be. Exactly. And the way bonds work, this is a little less, it's a little confusing. It's like an auction system. So I say, I'm the US government. I need to borrow $100 million. I'll offer you two percent interest and everyone goes crickets. They say no. And I say, well, I'll offer you two and a half percent crickets. I say three crickets. I say four. They go, all right, I'll buy something. And they buy some of our debt. So the more demand there is for bonds, the lower that auction, the more, the easier it is for me to get a low. I can go for two percent and then everyone buys it. That's not what happened. That's why it's so crazy because that was the big idea of tariffs. Like, okay, we were going to crash stock market, but everyone's going to buy US debt and we're going to get a real low interest payment. And the idea of it being refinanced at a lower rate from my understanding is that if bonds are available right now and we can list those bonds at a lower rate, but the economic situation elsewhere is dire enough. It doesn't matter that the rate on the bonds is 1% or lower. People will want to buy those bonds, which is refinance in the debt at a lower rate than what it's been sold at for the last couple of years. Right. They don't want to lose money in stocks. Everything else is unpredictable, but I can get a guaranteed 1% or 2% from America, all by their bonds. And the reason that's so relevant right now is because we are ridiculously far in debt. We owe a bunch of money. We have to raise more money to keep paying down the debt. So if the US government can raise money via bonds while paying less because the bonds are low, that saves the US government a ton of money. A ton of it. We massive amounts of money. Interest experience is like almost as big as our military budget right now. So we really need to get the interest fix down. That was the idea. The problem is people were not buying American bonds. They just weren't doing it. In fact, they were selling them, which drives up, makes the bar, you have to go up 4.5%, 5%. But it was rising because Japan was dumping, China technically didn't dump, but a lot of people were dumping. And so it was creating the opposite effect. And when both things are bad, it's chaos. I mean, it's like it could break the whole system. So I think that's why he panicked today. This was my big question for you. I think that was the part I did not understand. So from my perspective, as somebody who's bought a treasury before a bond, could I have sold it for the period of time that I had it? I guess the right to get the payout. And why does them selling their bonds at, is it because they're selling bonds that they bought at the four or five percent during inflation? So if the government's selling at the time, they have to offer higher rates. Exactly. Exactly what it is. They're selling their bonds. People can just buy it from them. They don't need to buy it from America at whatever rate. So you have to go higher to offer it. That's the idea. So, you know, probably more than anyone needs to know, but a good way to understand like the plumbing of the financial system and what was happening and why it was so chaotic as of yesterday, because the bonds were spiking, the stocks were going down, and that is a terrible double combo that needed something to change because it could get disastrous. Now, we're in the situation. People were flooding into the de-bloon market. No, kidding. So we have a little stock game where we all drafted some stocks. The number one stock yesterday and the whole competition was gold. Was just gold. Oh, the gold stock that is just to be tied to the value. The gold stock. It's just to be tied to the value. The cooling gold. The cooling gold. Bricks of gold was number one because everything was payout. That's not true today because everything's bounced back, but as of yesterday. So I want to do a little presentation here and I want to catch people up because we're going to talk about China today. I think this is a good intro. I think we went into why a China tariff might make sense, but why I think we went around it a weird way. So this video, tariffs are on, tariffs are off. We've been out of ducksies and ravises and we don't know what's going on. I want to flash back to World War II and give like a super brief primer on how we got here and what's going on. Because you were there. You know what it's like. You know what it's like. You know what? You can actually not only was I there, some other people were there. So there was the access powers as you can see here. That was a good transition. These are the access powers and they were fighting. I'm sorry. Historical images. Can we please focus here? These are the access powers from Germany and the Indian Japan. That's our thumbnail for the episode. And then these were the Allied powers. Okay. The guy in the bottom right kind of played both sides. He was kind of like, you know, one of the war. He's on one side. He's on one side. So we had the access and Allied powers. Okay. Turns out at the end of the war, the Allied powers won. The bottom two here. The American president famously only had like two thirds of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just style at the time. Right. That was the right. That's why he couldn't walk. It was just a lot of brain. It was just a lot of brain. It was a lot of brain. Yeah. What to call you? A lot of people don't know that. Yeah. It was brain rot. Anyway, the Allies win. These bottom two here were kind of destroyed though. UK and Russia were kind of destroyed. So it's kind of like an American empire. I'm not an American golden age. All right. Post-World War II America's still got all the infrastructure. They got everything built. And it's a great time. And because they're the most powerful country in the world at the time, biggest military, best manufacturing, they set up the global world order basically in a way that benefits them. So there's the UN. There's the World Trade Organization. There's a bunch of other things that the United States sets up and is like the leader of that sort of organized global trade. And that is run for decades. Through the Cold War was the only other power that kind of opposed America was Russia, but then by the 90s, they're gone. Collapse. So now it's, they called it the end of history kind of a 92. America's one. It's over. There's no other. This way of working is going to be the end. Okay. Then in 2000, again, this is like all were little kids. The year 2000, something significant happens. I think Bill Clinton's the president of the time. They welcomed China into the WTO, which is the World Trade Organization. They say China, you are now getting the same trade rules as everyone else in the WTO. So you can trade freely. There's no tariffs on you. You're all part of the thing. We talking, we talking dang era. Is that, you know, I, I don't know the Chinese leader at the time, but so it's 2000. At the time this happened, these are the nations that traded more with America in blue and once traded more with China in red. Okay. This is the state of the world at the time of the WTO entering China. Flash forward just 24 years. The world is drastically different. Now almost everybody trades more with China than they do with us. China now makes a third of all manufactured goods more than US, Japan, Germany, and South Korea combined. They have just leapfrogged the globe in terms of manufacturing. Half of the new world's industrial robots are made in China. Global shipbuilding, 55% in China. Actually not an important thing. They control the lithium ion battery industry. They control the drone industry. They're leading in electric vehicles. There's a lot of areas that China has now become a strategic power in over the course of the last 24 years of trade. And you know, whether it's fair, there's many arguments that most sides will make about who's being unfair and what's going on and whether China stole IP or what there's a lot to talk about. And I think there's merits on all sides here. But what I think America is seeing, I think through a really kind of unfortunately foggy dense Donald Trump lens, but it's like that something is going on here. So we're falling behind something. In some way, we need to stop this. And that is where the impulse to get these tariffs on China specifically comes from. And again, it's not just America. So I want to point this out because I think it's really important is that China has really focused on exports to grow their economy. That's their main thing. Because they had a real estate bust. Their internal stuff's kind of actually struggling, but exports are great. They're crushing exports. They're selling EVs all over the world. And every other country in the WTO, not just America, has been reporting more and more challenges. They've been flagging. They've been issues. This is a spike you can see in 24, but also just rising over the time of other countries doing WTO complaints or investigations against China. Specifically on the right, you can see they're coming from India, EU, Brazil, Australia, Turkey. Everyone has been kind of mad that China's all the manufacturing is leaving their countries and going to China, which has been just a global mecca superpower of manufacturing. So that's where we find ourselves. And that's why it's such an interesting time. Even the tariffs of Trump's first term did not stop this rise. In fact, it's grown in the past few years, Biden kept it things. So that's where we find ourselves. And that's why a coordinated global having a lot of allies working with you to maybe do a slowly but increasing tariff on China to keep some of the manufacturing out of the weather makes some sense. But when you're pissing off everybody, I want to show this clip. This is Australia. The unilateral action that the Trump administration has taken today against every nation in the world does not come as a surprise. For Australia, these tariffs are not unexpected, but let me be clear. They are totally unwarranted. President Trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. The reciprocal tariff would be zero. That's all you really need to say. And that he says not 10% and we have a 10% when Australia. Australia would be a partner that we'd really want on our side if you were trying to make some deal against China. And that's why you can see. I mean, this year hasn't ended yet. But in 25, the probes against China have dropped because people are focusing on America. Every one of these countries in the WTO is more worried about what America is doing than what China is doing with manufacturing. So that's where we find ourselves. I wanted to set the stage on how much has changed the past 20 years and why this is like a big issue it's being talked about. One of the interesting things I was reading about some folks who run factories and we're just giving their experiences with this. One of the things they mentioned is that even like, it's not just raw materials to make things. It's even, for example, you showed all the automation robots to build things in factories. The idea that America is going to rebuild or any of these countries that basically the manufacturing has been lost because China just exports to everywhere and reduces their need to manufacture themselves. Like they make all the equipment that you would use to make a factory. Like if you were like, you know what, we are going to build our factories here. Okay, where are we going to buy the robots? Where are we going to buy the parts? Where are we going to buy? Where's the actual kind of rebuilding these things? It's all from China. So it's like, yeah, it's crazy. And why I have been shocked at the, you know, again, those couple people who have been saying like, oh, yeah, we can definitely rebuild like Peter Navarro, we can build in America. It just feels it's not lined up with reality at all. So I mean, what you're saying is if you had kept the, the allies in good standing with you with the US, like if the US had treated everybody better along the way and had said, let's come up with a plan to build manufacturing globally in a way that doesn't allow China to dominate this market in this way, we can all work together to make that change. But we're isolating ourselves from them as well. Yeah, that's why that's why that's the part that makes me the most frustrated because it feels like a self-own for no gain. There's like not even a strategy to that. Pissing off Australia and Europe and all these partners at the time when we need them the most for a coordinated plan, you bring up a really good point. And the reason why we need to have coordinate efforts is not just because it's a nice thing to do or because it might work better is because in the past, what happens when you tariff a country like China is, let's say it's a thing called trans shipping. If they're sending goods to America and we put a 50% tariff on them, then usually what happens is they stop sending it from America and they send it to Thailand first or Vietnam first and they put a bow on it or they add one little thing or they, and now it suddenly made in Thailand or made in Vietnam or made in Mexico. And the classic example in clothing is that you put the, you put literally just the tag on. Yeah. A final tag of the good and then you send it on for there. And now it's under a Vietnam tariff of 10% and it's out of 50. And that there's no answer unless you have that unless that country is working with you and this is what's going to happen. Even when they're not working with you, I mean, it's so hard to clamp down on global trade when someone has a better manufacturer. So here's an example. We've had a pretty good coordinated global blockade or something on Russia. Sanctions on Russia. In the meantime, suddenly Finland and Kazakhstan are buying a lot more European and American goods than they ever were before and it's finding its way across the border into Russia. You know, luxury cars that are not allowed to be sold in Russia are ending up in Finland and suddenly ending up in St. Petersburg. That's just what happens and that's with like a coordinated effort. It's like, it's very hard to clamp down on it when if they can't make the cars and they want to buy them, it's going to end up there. They'll find a way. It's like how you want the Xiaomi SU7 and you're going to illegally import it through Mexico. I even talked about that on and off the pod. I have thought about it and then I found out that I would be arrested for smuggling. It could be a massive jail sentence and fines. I do want that SU7. We should bring Chinese EVs back to America. I know what's ours. Yeah. Respectfully. That brings up one last story I want to say, which is about, this is a Chinese company named CIMC. They make like tractor trailers like the chassis for a trailer. They just take steel, they bend it and make it good, they make it cheap. It's amazing. They're really good at it. They were selling them in America and undercutting everybody because they were just better at it. American chassis tractor trailer guys were pissed. They demanded tariffs. Some way to stop it. That was crazy. It was first trump term. It was granted. So what CIMC did is they rebranded it to CIE manufacturing with an American star in Eagle. And they set up a factory in America. They did what everyone wants. They made a factory in America. They brought their knowledge and expertise. They set up in a cheap area of America and they started making these things. And then they noticed they were getting outcompeted by their American counterparts. They were like, damn, this is crazy. We can't. We just can't do it in America. And they looked into it and they found out that their American counterparts were buying Chinese ones from Vietnam, shipping them in and rebranding them. So the Chinese company was competing in some American companies that were actually Chinese. It's a whole weird system that is happening that creates these weird incentives. And what I'm trying to get across is like the best solution is just to be the one that can make it good. If you're good at manufacturing, all these problems disappear. But if you're not, there's so many loopholes and whack-a-moves you have to do to try and protect your less competitive industries. A couple episodes we talked about, I think, subsidies. That's kind of the other end of this, right? Like the carrot instead of the stick is that if you wanted to put something into place to help an actual American manufacturer compete with a Chinese company, you could subsidize it instead of applying tariffs to the Chinese goods and go that route as well. Yeah, I think that was like the Build Back Better plan. They tried some of that. They did it with the Ships Act. There was, you know, it's mixed because we've had real problems with getting the funding. Companies that got the funding did pretty well. There was a growth in manufacturing. It's tough to say. But I would lean more towards that than this entirely stick route because I just don't think it deals with these very obvious workarounds that are... I also seem so clearly that the tariff should be targeted rather than blanket because then you can be really focused and say, like with chips, that's a huge, huge, huge security vulnerability for America and anybody to have to depend on Taiwan for chips. Right? If China goes and takes Taiwan, which is, you know, the kind of nuclear scenario that people worry about, like chips are in everything. They're in everything. They're in your car door handle. Not just your car, your car door handle. They're in our door handle. They're in our switch-tools. It's not just the things you think about like your phone. It's in everything. It's in our fridges. It's in our smart devices around like everything uses chips now. And there is an increasing level of production that the rest of the world is trying to do, particularly China with less sophisticated chips, but the best ones still come from Taiwan. That's what powers everything right now, including military stuff as we start to like get military drones and the crazy like sci-fi stuff. And so it is so critically important to have chips. And right now that it's like not being manufactured. Up until recently, TSMC has opened a factory in Arizona that's starting to get up to speed and doing well. But that was like a big focus with the Biden administration that I think they did well. I think it was called the Chips Act, right? Yeah. With the Chips Act where that was like, okay, TSMC, the company who makes all these chips in Taiwan, basically the only one in the world who's doing this, we got them to come build a factory in America. And that's like a critical vulnerability that is not solved, but it's better now. In the process of fixing it. Yes. My understanding is like that's such a small amount of the number of chips that we need for any kind of sustainable future that if right now Taiwan were to be taken by China and China says, fuck you Donald Trump, no chips for you, you don't get our chips. Like we are super boned. Like super insanely boned. Yeah. I mean, it's tough from Taiwan's POV because like if they do build the best chip manufacturing in America, then America doesn't have incentive to protect them, right? Like right now, the entire rest of the world is super incentivized to not allow China to take Taiwan because then everybody else in the world is mega fuck. Yeah, yeah. That was my first thought when I started reading about this specific topic. It was like, if I was Taiwan, I would not do this. I would not do this. It's like slowly giving rid of my big shield and then handing it to someone else. You'll protect me, right? Yeah. All right. Okay. Say, I'm in the villain chair. But I think he is playing four D-chests. Okay. I think there was no problem with the across the board tariffs. I think this is all a part of the plan and I think we need to shake the system up to make significant change. Okay. You've been saying that off the pod. And I've been saying that on and off. You've been saying that off the pod. Oh, we... One of the... I had basically a few questions to try and get you to push against these arguments. Okay. I don't think a lot of... Because I don't think that many people are necessarily even in this camp, even if they did vote for Trump. It is interesting to see the public divergence on... You have been in the hot-goat. He needs to be in the hot-goat. The first thing I wanted to bring up is the stock market gets mentioned all the time. It's... We're plummeting. We're going in a recession. Stock market used as an indicator of economic health. But I would argue, hey, I'm just a normal guy. I'm... I have a middle-income job. I don't have a lot invested in stocks. Maybe nothing invested in stocks. Like most people in the country don't. And if the market's going up or crashing, that affects... You know, the rich people. And it's not a very good indicator of economic success in the country. What would you say to something like that? Because I do feel like that argument comes up a lot. And the reverse of this argument is when stocks are exploding in value, but wages are stagnating. People are struggling. And people point to it then. As like, well, the stock market's going up. Nvidia just 300X'd. But I still make the same salary I made five years ago and inflation's digging into it. So from the other side of it, now that it's crashing, why is that something I should care about? I totally agree. I don't think stocks are the perfect indicator of economic health. I think stocks can be up and the economy can be doing bad for regular people. However, stocks crashing is certainly not good for regular people for two reasons. Number one is most... You say most Americans don't have stocks. Most Americans actually do. It's just that the most of them are owned by rich people. But they do actually own stocks. And they haven't been a 401K, which is largely going to be the S&B 500. But when the S&B 500 drops, especially for people who are nearing retirement age, they are fucked. We are seeing people actually flooding social media saying, I have to now retire five years later. I have to post my retirement because I was counting on this to sell and retire on. And now it is 20% lower, 15% lower than it was. So that's part of it. The other part of it is the thing called the wealth effect where people that have a certain number of stocks that have been up that are green, they feel comfortable spending. They don't clamp down on spending. They feel like they buy that RV or they go on that vacation or whatever one thinks they feel like they're in a good spot. When things are down, they clamp down. They tighten spending. They keep saving. They hold back, which slows the economy down. The third thing, and that's probably the most important. And you could probably deal with your mogul merch, is like, if you are importing a bunch of goods from, let's say China or Vienna or anything that has a tariff. And it gets to the harbor and you have to pay that tariff. You need working capital. You need money in your bank account ready to pay that. And if you don't have that, which most companies don't, you have to do immediate layoffs just to get your goods out of the harbor because if you don't get them out, they auction them. And then your competing against your own goods that are being sold at auction. So what we're seeing, and this is what's happening already, we only had one day of real tariffs or 10% now. But companies are having to do immediate, like, like, close plants do layoffs immediately. There's no delay. And that means working class jobs lost instantly. And there's no problem. So I'm making this argument as the 28 year old, who isn't retiring, who doesn't have a lot invested, you're still saying that the downstream effects of something like this happening. So, so, there's no good downstream effects. That's my point. What I'm saying is, it reminds me of you speaking of Trigger Down. The Chinese Communist Party of People's Twitter account tweeted a Ronald Reagan speech on tariffs. Yeah. We were in the upside down world. It's crazy. I saw it. I don't know, yeah, I don't know where we're. But that that was right. Reagan was a Chinese plant. No, it's a long time. It's a long time. It's a long time. It's a long time. The whole time. That's 40 chess. They sent us Reagan 50 years ago. Damn. Are the deal. Fair enough, eloquent answer. OK. But haven't there been times in Triak? Haven't there been times in history where tariffs were necessary for the US to succeed and grow? I remember something from a very own stream of yours where you mentioned that tariffs used in the 1800s when the US was trying to develop its own manufacturing sector, used tariffs against countries like the UK in order to protect from competition of countries that already industrialized. And then they utilized those tariffs to grow in the 1800s. I believe you said that in a video. First of all, never a triathlon. First of all, use my words against me. So I'm wondering, a triok, if it worked back then and we can point to an example of it working at least once in the past that I do remember that you brought up, why couldn't it be that happening again now? So what I was saying, you got it. Fuck. What I would say to that is that that sounds like a targeted tariff on a specific industry. You think it's critically important. I think in this case it was shipbuilding where like America wanted to build its own shipbuilding so that and UK could do it better so they tariffs so they could build their own. I am not necessarily opposed to it in a very targeted case to get one industry you think is critically important as a broad case. And I think in the 1800s, this happened anyway. It still creates rising tensions, trade wars, tit for tat tariffs where they try to counterbalance on you that ends up with everyone being poorer. That's my overall stance. I think if we thought EVs are so important to have in America that we're going to tariff them and I don't get my nice Xiaomi SU7 EV that I can drive around and look cool in, I can at least understand. I'm not mad about it, but I can understand it. But trying to do all goods at all once every country is disastrous. It's crazy. I feel like you're deconstructing my generalized argument and making very specific points that are difficult to argue with. Protectors character. So I would like to hear a piece of shit. Old ball. Old ball. No, no. Okay. Okay. I'm going to have to get another thought. I didn't know that. All right. The current Argentinian president, who I forget the name of, basically campaigned on this idea that in order to repair the economic circumstances that we're in, we are going to need to go through a period of pain in order to succeed and come out the other side more successful. The pain that we're feeling right now is a part of the plan. It has to happen in order to create large economic change in the country. In order to get to a state where we're a happier, better, financially better off country, we need to go through a period of damage like this in order for that to happen. And Javier ended his speech calling you bald. And then he did mention that. This is the period of pain I'm going through to grow. And then he called me bald. I'm in private. He apparently is it by not a Spanish to blue. Yeah. Okay. Last one I want to say on this, that is fucking insane. That was the dumbest thing you've ever seen. Because, because I want to talk about it. The dumbest thing I've ever seen. Because Javier Muley, not that I agree with everything he said, but had a completely opposite viewpoint. He's completely anti-terror, totally open, free trade, totally. So it's like saying, if I shoot you in the leg and you're like, I'm in pain. I'm like, well, Javier Muley said going through a period of pain. It's an entirely different thing. It's not a relevant example. It doesn't mean all pain will always lead to growth. It just means that guy thought and that is this is. Javier said anytime you're in pain, it's good. But I disagree. I'm at disagree wholeheartedly with that. Okay. Counterpoint in the 1800s, we used to do bloodletting to kill people. Yeah. That was me guilty. I'm old now. Yeah. Okay. I used to bloodlet. No, I don't, listen. I don't know. I'm trying to be as generous as I can to what I think is a pretty dumb idea. I think we're not benefiting. Okay. I have one more question. And this is something, this is something a little more genuine, less fill in cherry. Okay. You mentioned last week that a big part of becoming a more developed economy is you sort of naturally lose these manufacturing jobs over time to developing nations behind you that kind of pick up those jobs and are able to supply them with like lower cost of labor, right? Yeah. You mentioned that the developed country, like the US, maybe the Norway's or the Denmark's or France, you move on to producing more complicated goods that those countries aren't able to produce and you're specializing in offering like new services that allow your country to keep making things basically. Yeah. Move up the value chain. You move up the value chain. That was the way you described it. Is there no, what is the end game of moving up the value chain though? You could, there's forever, you're forever progressing in a game where countries are chasing your country and trying to catch up. Is it not worth fighting to maintain the original base manufacturing jobs in some way? Because even if I move up the value chain, maybe 20, 30 years from now, those jobs are being chased by Vietnam because they developed even further along the way. Do you know what I'm saying? I sort of know what you're saying. That's not a problem I can solve in this channel. I don't know. I don't know. I feel like we've been solving so many global issues along the way. And let me say, after we talked about terrorists last week, they went away. They don't know. So he dropped on. That is a good way. Before we recorded our next episode, right? Right. That's a good point. I think he's watching. I think he's hooked. I don't know. I think you had a good point. Actually, last week, you were talking about this. It's like, if you lose the base manufacturing, eventually you lose the skill set that allows you to get to the... You know, if you can't make batteries, you can't make the high. I'm not convinced that we will just be higher on the value chain than the rest of the world forever. I don't think there's many indicators that we as Americans or people in the West are inherently. I mean, it's like if you just think about most of the centuries where the West has dominated the global world and technology. China, India, the global southeast, they've been an immense poverty. And then over the past few decades, you've had what, two billion people lifted out of poverty. The idea that we are some sort of like, God race is just insanity. And I don't see if you just look at what's coming out of China and Taiwan and Singapore and India and the sheer number of people. It's like, I don't see how America maintains its position as like, we are the ones high on the value chain. We should be managing everything. So I'm somewhat pessimistic about this. Like the tech industries are exploding in other parts of the world. Totally. Yeah. Well, I think a good demonstration of this actually is Chinese manufacturing because I think up until recently and now that these discussions are more popular and more in the news, I think people used to have this idea of sweatshop in China, like getting together this like shittily made good. And that's what Chinese manufacturing is. And people have that idea from a really long time ago. But what people don't realize is that the manufacturing industry and this push for exports is they specialized and developed supply chains to create really complex, high end goods, even doing something within the world of clothing that I gave the example of is it's not just about doing like things more cheaply. It's about offering more refined services that are not, they do not really exist in other countries a lot of the time. There's a level of moving up the value chain. Yeah, the level of specialization is that. Yeah, we don't have, in America, we don't have people who can make these factories and China has just this obscene amount of like STEM graduates who are focusing specifically on manufacturing. It's like, dude, they're, they're lapping us. Like they're going so far beyond any other country. And like it feels a little daunting. I don't see how it stops and I don't think Trump's shit is helping it all, but I don't know. It's funny because maybe do you have something one more thing? Well, I want to say I don't have the graph in front of me. But what I saw recently is that China is kind of going through the very beginnings, the baby steps of a similar thing where the bottom part of the value chain is going somewhere else. Yes, yes. Like it's going to Vietnam. It's going to Indonesia. It's going to India where it's like, it's now too expensive for that very basic level to do in China. So they're going somewhere else. So it might be a cycle. You know, I think at the end of the day, you want to be the one making the electric vehicle or the Boeing jet or the tech company rather than the company making the toasters and the t-shirts. I think I believe in that, but I can see the value of having some competency at the base level. The cap to this conversation in my mind is this stuff is changing literally day to day, almost hour by hour. So it's hard to draw like a conclusion about what even the short term will be. I'm very curious if this 90 day pause will last. I'm very curious to see if it just comes back or a bunch of the countries. Dude, if in 90 days we're in the exact same situation, I'm a freak out. I'm going to lose it. Like I'm assuming this 90 pause is a nice way of saying we're going to go out and get deals with everybody, bring it all down except for China and focus. I assume at the best case scenario that's what they're doing. But if we end up with no negotiations, no deals and in 90 days we're back to this, it's going to be good content. I guess it's going to be disastrous. Oh, man. Well, I have a very different topic that I was thinking about bringing up last week that I thought was really interesting, which was recently the South Korean government came out and for the first time ever took public accountability for the fact that they were basically just selling kids for a long time. The post-Korean war, there was a bunch of South Korean children that were adopted. Primarily to the US, I think there was over 200,000 children in total. I was like kind of post war period. You bought a couple of them, right? You were... Yeah, back when I was at back post-Korean war, I was like, why don't I get a couple of kids? Korean kids. There's a different life for me back then. How's the different guy? And of those 200,000, 150,000 of them were kids that went to America. The thing is, this is kind of during the period of Korean economic miracle, like rapid growth in the country, and there's two sides to this issue that are coming up. And a lot of these kids abroad realize over time that they had fake background or history given to them. Through a variety of things. But they made it up? They made it up? No, or kind of. So the most common example I could find is, in a lot of cases, these adoption agencies in Korea, which are making money off of like letting foreigners adopt the kids, would run into situations where maybe a child in their care would die. So I as an American who wants to adopt a child, maybe thinks, oh, I would love to help out this orphan from the Korean War. And I learned her name, and I want to bring her over, adopt her, bring her into my family, right? And I go through that process, and the agency gives me all their background information. I adopt the child. I sign like paperwork in the US to make them a US citizen. But on the other side of this is the adoption agency that quietly, that child passed away during the time their kids. They're just switching the kids. They're just swapping new kid in, who's, for example, whose parents are still alive. So a lot of the kids weren't orphans at these agencies, right? They're just kids put up for adoption with their birth parents still alive. And then a bunch of these Korean adoptees over time found out that their backgrounds were facing. They're not orphans. And that this large scale, basically adoption fraud had been happening in Korea throughout all this time. And a bunch of people have challenged this and tried to take these cases to the South Korean government and to get them to acknowledge that this happened and to get an apology, to get payments for damages, different types of things, right? And I sort of first encountered this story, I think six or seven years ago, way before this apology happened, because there's a short vice piece on this Korean adoptee in the US whose name is Adam. And he was adopted by a family that abused him. They were really shitty family. He lived basically a terrible childhood. And the family he got stuck with never filled out the paperwork in the US to make him a citizen. And then because of his, like, I would say because of his upbringing, he wound up in a lot of situations where he wound up committing like crimes when he was younger through like his teenage years and his 20s, he cleans up his act, becomes a business owner, has a wife, has a kid. Now he's in his 40s, right? And he, through this process, eventually finds out that his paperwork was never done properly and then submits an application for a green card like he should be eligible for. But because he submits that application, it flags the system that if you have any criminal history and you're an illegal immigrant, they deport you. But he hasn't lived in Korea. Because it's 40 years in a minute. He doesn't speak Korean. He doesn't know anything about Korean culture. And then he gets sent to Korea. And this is a big story back then. During my research of this general story around Korea apologizing for their end of the fuck-ups here, I followed up on Adam's story now that it's been years later. And he made it to successfully sue the Korean government for the situation that he was in. And he got paid out $75,000. Wow. When he took him back to America. But he still cannot go back to the US. So he stuck in Korea? As of 2023, he was still stuck in South Korea and couldn't come back to the United States. This is a bizarre situation where in the wake of this economic growth period for Korea, coming out of the Korean War, at least within the ceasefire deal that they had, the Korean companies have this awful incentive to get through, basically get as many kids as they can into their facilities and sell them off as adoptees to as many families as they can because of the money they were bringing in. And then on the other end, the American process, if the family wasn't willing to do the paperwork or just made mistakes on the other end, it has long term consequences for the adoptees on the American side. And I thought there was a pretty wild, fucking story. That's fucking crazy. And then this one more little tie in that I thought is, you know, in the wake of the Trump presidency, there's been a lot of changes to the way like immigration and deportations have been happening. There's a big story right now with this guy named, a Barrego Garcia, who basically is from Maryland. And he's originally from El Salvador. He came to escape gang violence in El Salvador when he was 16. He's now 29. And he has his, he has his like paperwork. He has asylum in the country. The reason that this happened is in 2019, he got arrested or pulled over on accusation of being involved in gang activity in the US. And he gets led off because the gang activity accusation is totally baseless. They're saying he's an operative of like MS-13 in New York. He's literally never lived in New York. He's from Maryland. And through this process, he's granted legal asylum and protection that he cannot be deported. He's now like legally living in the United States. Now he, you know, just normal, basically normal citizen in the US has a US citizen wife has a kid and gets deport is in the group of deportees that just got sent to El Salvadorian presence. So he's in the El Salvador prison right now. And he legally could be in the US. And the Trump administration said directly that this is just an administrative error, that it was just an accident. But now that he's there, the Trump administration is like, he's under El Salvador's control, we can't do anything about it. And they're not bringing him back. And he's still there right now, which is insane to begin with. And this has been litigated. It's gone to like a circuit court. They demanded that he be returned by like Monday of this week. And then this Supreme Court just overruled that and said like, you can't give that deadline it's like unrealistic, that it doesn't make sense that you as the Supreme Court overruled deadline. That just the deadline. But they're not commenting on whether or not he needs to come back or not. And the Trump administration's whole argument is like, this is just out of our hands now. We can't do anything about this. So this guy who was legally in the US through the asylum process is now stuck in a prison in El Salvador because of it, and acknowledged quote, administrative error, which I think is insane. I think these are just two examples. I think I have like pretty hard opinions about like anyone being deported in the first place. But I think these two stories, years apart, you know, in Adam's case, I think his may have been in the first Trump presidency. But I think his type of case is like wouldn't have mattered if Biden was president or not. Like that is nothing, nothing necessarily would have changed. There's just two examples of like work technicalities, like ruin people's lives and put them in unwinnable positions because of the way we like choose to conduct this process. And then on the other end of it, it's like people being like having their history robbed from them because of money. And I just thought this was all like really interesting in the different examples of this. It's actually sad. It's very interesting. It wasn't the word. Yeah. It's incredibly depressing. I mean, talking to a guy in the prison is so interesting. Obviously, you know what I mean, it's not the right word. I'm sorry. So interesting. So yeah, I just dug into that is like the, you know, the greed, the greed of the adoption agencies, the immigration promise. It's your point that we should start an adoption agency because there's just a good money. And I was well, if we start adopting Korean kids, I think we get, we would just do it right. I think we should do the agency. The agency is making the money. They're selling the kids, right? Also, we do want to make the money. We do want to sell the kids. We do it as originally. The coffee of the space 75. We got to get higher on the value chain. Exactly. You know, it's, you know, it's wild speaking of, you just tell them, they're my, speaking of selling orphans who have parents, okay. A little, a little segue. I, when I was 18, I went to Nepal for three months and volunteered in orphanage. And that sounds great, right? Like, wow, what a virtuous young man. How smart and humble enhance them. But which, you know, it's all good. And there's all these pictures of me like, which I love. I was, you know, and I was, um, yeah, Perry and I went to the same high school. We like, they wrote an article about me. It's like, Doug went off to Nepal to help the children in the hill. No, this is real. Yeah. And so I did this. This is right after high school. And, um, and, you know, I was like, okay, it's the same team a little off, but it's a good organization and all that. And then over the subsequent years, it turns out that a lot of particularly in Nepal, these orphanages that are a sort of popular place for foreigners to go and volunteer at to help these orphans. A lot of them are in orphans because the parents in the rural countryside in Nepal realize that if they send their child to this orphanage in Kathmandu, the city, that a bunch of foreigners will come and support them with money. And then we'll get a better education. And so really what I did is I went and like hung out near a school that said it was an orphanage that had parents like a boarding school, I guess. And so already it felt a little weird when I was there. It's like something felt kind of off. You see the kids parents right over there. Yeah, they're like peeking over the corner or whatnot. And so it's strange that I think well intentioned. I mean, certainly people running the orphanage were very well intentioned. They were trying to help orphans, right? And there were legitimate orphans. But this reminds me of that story of like this orphanage in Korea, it's literally selling children who have parents. Like that's a lot more, I think, vile than what was happening in Nepal or is, I don't know, but it's weird that that's a common thing apparently. Well, I think the theme that it's both these stories and almost everything we've talked about is like not enough discussion of incentives. You know, that's if there's an incentive, because there's money to be made from people who are willing to abuse it. People will be. And it may not be everybody, right? It's not that everybody has the same moral code and always faced with the same decision. Everybody would be, you know, robbing those Korean kids with their history. Yeah. It's just that because the position is allowed to exist, the guy's willing to make the decision is willing to step up to do it. Yeah. Which is, I'm like, bat. It is bad. It is fucking. No, no, you said it was interesting. Yeah, it was interesting. I think it's gonna be kind of like that. I don't remember what he said. Yeah, it's like a little smiley. A little smirk for the audio. You can't get a podcast story out of it. He gave us a, he gave us a toothy grin. I know we suffered in you. You have trauma about your whole history being robbed from you, but I just like to tear it on a podcast every time and he's a really depressing story. Smiles because he knows he can get content. He's just being green, dude. He's going. Oh, man. Maybe I need to be lighter. I'm sorry. I know. I mean, I don't know what to say about it to be honest. It's really depressing. It's sad. No, I don't think it's funny because it's funny. It's funny. Funny. I'm just thinking funny. He didn't count me. Funny and interesting story about children being sold. If you show any of these stories, if you, if you approach almost anyone at an individual level and you confront them personally about one of these stories and the human being behind it, there is almost every single person would come to an agreement about, oh, this is bad. This is a, this is a bad thing that is happening. Why do we do this? We should fix this. It shouldn't work this way. The easiest example is like a personal example in my life is a shake who edits for Ludwig is a DACA recipient. And if shake, you know, if shake had maybe a harder life growing up in the US, he came from the Czech Republic when he was like two. And he made some mistakes when he was younger and like, you know, committed a crime. He made some mistakes now he works for Ludwig. He's made many mistakes. Well, he's made, you know, that's not a felony. So far. And, uh, if the taxes get out, if something just happened, like if he made a mistake along the way, uh, then the, he could just be deported from the country. And it's like his, you know, his primary identity, it's like he does appreciate that he's checked from like talking to him about it. But then you can just have all of that rob from you, basically on a technicality. And, uh, even, I think the idea behind this is like, you don't want to protect people that are, uh, criminals. You don't, you don't want to deal with them in the system or deal with them in your country. But I think it's kind of on the obligation of the system or the country that these people existed within to deal with it. Yeah. I mean, even if even if this person were like, imagine shake is a violent criminal. Imagine. I don't even imagine. I can't do. Visual examples. He goes on a little rampage. And he's been in the US his whole life. I don't feel like it's chill to just send him back to the check like everything's chill. He's what a jail him here. Yeah. I feel like we should deal. We should take responsibility that action at the very end. Sure. Drizzle is our problem. Yeah. Start building those Venezuelan prisons back here in America. Put the prison. Thank you, Doug. And that's where I wanted to circle back to. And if we could, uh, if we could give all of those jobs to private prison, uh, private prison companies, I don't know, being the best max the profit of all of those companies. And maybe we'd dump a little money in this shares of those of those companies. And we did that. No, you bring up a point, um, that I think ties in too, which is like, I don't think I am even at the point where I can disagree ideologically because I don't like the implement. I think the implementation is so random. You know, I'm saying, if you're of the opinion that we have to, I don't know, reduce the number of doc up recipients we give out a year and you're like, measure doing that. That's something you could argue about. But when you like, if you're, if you're randomly setting someone up for 30 years to think one way and then you cut it out from their foot, that's that random cruelty that really bothers me. The idea that you're not making a measure change to like the future. You are undercutting things you've promised in the past or you're like, you're, you're causing damage. No one could have prepared or planned for that. I think that's the really frustrating part. It's something, it's a basic situation that anybody would look at and agree is unfair. And I think the, I, I think it helps to boil things down into these specific examples of issues because then if you can also clearly agree about it, then it kind of points about that last week is maybe it can be easier to work towards to change. That's what you would hope at least. I think we changed the tariffs. We can change this where everything we talk about in this show will get fixed. This, I think this actually loops in to last week because a lot of people had positive and negative things to say about the idea behind abundance, the book, the idea that building is kind of the future of solving problems, like building up the supply side of things so that the demand for it can be matched. Housing was the specific example that you dove into really heavily. I want to come to the other side of that if we have time to talk about building too much because you had talked about that. On a lighter note from this, this extremely sad orphan stuff, let's talk about this power plant in Ecuador collapsing and all the people that are dying. Let's lighten the mood a bit. Okay, so the main thing I want to chat about today is China and the Belt and Road Initiative, which is their thing around the world that they are basically trying to help all of these countries around the world build up a whole bunch of infrastructure. It's an interesting counterpoint to what the US has done. I do want to quickly follow up on some of the things that were said last week because I was very heated in the way I discussed things and saw a lot of comments that match that passion in various ways. Just a few follow-ups just to touch on things that I saw in the comments about what I said last week. I talked a lot about housing, about red versus blue states. I just want to follow up and acknowledge that yes, a city like Houston is blue. I understand that, but the point is more about the fact that so many people are moving from blue states to red states that in an electoral college, the way our presidential system works, that will actually majorly affect the ability of the democratic nominee to win. That is the relevancy of red versus blue in the context of building a lot of housing. I might not have expressed that super clearly, but the point isn't that Houston is blue, it's that it's in a red state. That is what is relevant to that particular conversation. On top of that, I think people felt frustrated that I conflated Democrats and various groups on the left. That's a fair criticism. I will be more cognizant of that going forward. I also realized it'd be really frustrating if you're, if you see yourself as, for example, progressive, you're also very front-up fed up with the way that the democratic party is governing as I have been. Then I am sitting here like lumping you all together and being like, you're all doing a bad fucking job. That would be very frustrating. I can very much empathize with that. I'll be more thoughtful of that going forward. Even though for me, this is not meant to be a left versus right thing with building. It's just, I think the country doesn't build enough and we just need to build more stuff. Of course, there's a lot of complexities of homelessness like empty units held by corporate interests. I don't personally think that would solve affordability. Maybe that helps with homelessness, but there's many nuances to that that obviously we didn't get into. I wanted to at least touch on those things. Yuck. And again, I hate nuance. It's got you and I'm going to leave a comment about it. Yeah. The fact that you would pay like this. I know. Be fucking cave. Don't let them shake. Yeah. I am. Shripled out. I appreciate constructive criticism. And there. Yeah. And I think there's valid things. It's not like I want to like get riled up by every single comment, but I think to be fair, maybe I didn't express some nuance to the extent that I could have in my passionate rant. And I think at the end of the day, like I just want people's lives to be better and I think building is necessary for like people being old afford to live. It's necessary for the future being better with like medicine and healthcare and new technologies and a better life. And it's necessary to solve the climate crisis because we have to build a lot of stuff to solve climate. So I just think building regard is I'm not saying the right is doing some great job. I don't think that I just we just need to build and there's examples in abundance specifically that I kept highlighting over and over that I again, as to me, not about Democrats versus Republicans really. Just build more or you don't build too much, which is what China's done. So let's let's segue into it. So is you actually mentioned earlier for back to China? We're back to China. Okay. And I think it's an interesting counterpoint was always back to China because again, you know, I was I was bitching and moaning about how America doesn't build anything. And China has basically done the exact opposite. So in the 90s and 2000s, China was massively ramping up in production. And then based on largely the financial crisis is my understanding. This is a from an article by Noah Smith who's an economist due to the financial crisis. China's economy was hit really hard. Basically, they were manufacturing all this stuff for people. And then suddenly they weren't buying as much because Europe, America are in this huge recession. And so to compensate for that for two-ish decades, they started building tons and tons and tons of housing and other infrastructure. And so because they were just building this absolutely obscene amount of stuff, one of the stats is they were spending about 44% of their GDP every year on infrastructure compared to like 20% that other countries do. So they're like massively invested at like a double rate of anybody else. And then that bubble sort of burst in 2018. The housing prices cratered and they've now shifted to this like heavy export model, like you talked about, which is called like conflite, you know, causing a lot of the problems in the world. So that's interesting on its own. But then the Belt and Road Initiative is an interesting part of this. So the Belt and Road Initiative is their global plan that they started in 2013 where they're going to go to a whole bunch of countries around the world. There's 150 of them signed up right now that and they're going to loan the money to do all these big, high infrastructure projects. Well, we're going to go into Kenya, we're going to build a train, we're going to go into Ecuador, we're going to build a power plant, we're going to go into Kazakhstan, we're going to build a whole bunch of trains. One big port. I was just saying ports, there's like a big one in Sri Lanka. Yeah. And so they have this plan and this sounds good on paper, right? It's like, oh, yeah, no, that's awesome. And so this kicked off and at first it was doing great. And the first five years, all these, you know, they were building stuff, all these countries were happy with it. And then there started to be issues. So if you look at the list of projects that China has done under Belt and Road Initiative, it is crazy. It is like, like so many of the major infrastructure projects in Africa are being funded and planned by Chinese contractors and the Chinese government working with the African government. Same with South America now, same with the Middle East, same with, like a North, you know, Kazakhstan, that whole air, like it's everywhere around the world, China is helping countries to build stuff. It's crazy. Do you know how there's a big industry in the Congo of like mining cobalt and other, like with your hands or something and you're dying? I mean, that is part of it. I think there's an unfortunate reality to the mining share is that it's not being done ethically. But if you watch these undercover reporting videos of stuff like that, of these like mineral mines in Africa in general, there's so many Chinese like intermediate areas there. Yes. And you can watch people go with like, you know, little spy cams on their chest and they go check out the mine and the human rights abuses. And then they go to where the minerals are being sold at a market and it's too, so many Chinese companies operated in these places. Yep. Like a giant percentage of the infrastructure investment is going to Chinese companies in Africa. A lot of the countries that's like 40% is something that I'm right. It's crazy. So they've China has successfully become incredibly impactful around the world building all these projects. And that contributes to this like trade that you talked about earlier, Brendan, we're now China is the main partner for most of the world in terms of trading in terms of infrastructure. And into their credit, right, they've been building such an absolutely obscene amount often to their own detriment. Like they caused this housing crash for themselves a few years ago. But they have just been building insane amounts. So they do have the expertise. Could you speak a little more to that? Because I know this is a topic you've talked about a lot too. And you mentioned 2018 and I know that the real estate sort of crisis that was ongoing, like they had a huge, I want to say one of the, their biggest, was it one of the two shuttered like two of their biggest real estate companies? Yeah. So the biggest in the world. So what is the consequence of how did building too much tie into that specifically? So basically they tried to get out of this problem where they weren't growing in other areas like exports by basically saying we are as a country are going to invest massively in housing and infrastructure. And we as the government, we're going to put huge, huge, huge quantities of our money into just building tons and tons and tons of stuff. And so there's one of like Guangzhou is the province, I think. They like are so proud of the fact they have like 1500 bridges and 11 airports and they're like $400 billion in debt. The province is like the size, it's smaller than Arizona. It's like a small area. I mean, not small, it's China, right? And there's a ton of people there. But like they way overbuilt their way in debt. And that was kind of how they funded things. That's how we as America are funding a lot of things. We just keep throwing money at the problem and getting deeper in debt. And they just kept doing this. And the reason everybody was like, yeah, let's keep doing this is because the housing crisis kept going up, but it didn't make sense because they're building so many. I can pull up the numbers in this giant stack of paper somewhere, but like they have like hundreds of millions of empty apartments because they just overbuilt. And the problem is just like the financial crisis in the US, all of the citizens invested their money into housing as an asset. They were like, this is going to be our investment. So they were paying insane rates to buy into housing. This bubble kept growing, but the actual value wasn't there. It didn't make sense. They had built way too many housing. They don't need that many apartments. Okay. The quality turned out to be really bad in a lot of cases, which is gets, which what we're about to get to a belt and road turns out massive rapid building isn't perfect. It doesn't work all the time. The quality part is interesting to me because I do think how this ties into what we were talking about earlier is this idea of something like Chinese manufacturing being like cheap and like badly made. And so I think when you present the argument initially about homes not being made well, that is a counter argument is like this, this, this, this stain of the idea that Chinese building is cheap. But on this topic specifically, somebody came into the yard discord. She's originally from China. And she talked about how this is a really big issue that the quality of housing in a lot of areas in the country is super low. They've built it and it's available, but it's very bad. Yeah. And then all these Chinese citizens like put their entire net worth into buying one of these things because they're like, this is one of the few ways as a Chinese citizen I can invest in my future. You don't really have the same options of the stock market necessarily that we do. It's much more controlled by the government, same with the tax sector or IPOing. And so they were like, we're going to put all of our money into this. But then like you said, it doesn't make sense in all these problems with the building. So that actually segues into the belt and road thing, right? One paper China over the past decade, 12 years has with hundreds of countries, I guess hundred has built all of these incredible things of infrastructure, including successfully a train in Kenya or Kazakhstan or Ecuador building this giant power plant. There's many, many, many examples of successfully completed projects. But if you pull up this Wall Street Journal article, Perry, this is basically, they're all falling apart. And so this Wall Street Journal article literally called China's global mega projects are falling apart. And some of, I mean, if you can just kind of scroll down through this, like some of the quotes are insane, low quality construction on some of the belt and road projects risk crippling key infrastructure and saddling nations with even more costs in Pakistan, official shut down the Neil M. J. L. M. hydro elective power plant last year after detecting cracks. Uganda's power generation company says has identified more than 500 construction defects in a Chinese built 183 megawatt hydro power plant on the Nile. Uganda officials have blamed a Chinese built hydropower plant in Angola, the vast social housing project is the locals there saying it's not well built, even Indonesia's high speed rail line in Jakarta, which is sometimes successively said, like, oh, this is one of our big key success stories of belt and road has had massive cost over runs and fell years behind schedule. It turns out these things are not working well. And so if you go to, there's another Wall Street article journal that is about, I think it's down here. So this Ecuador power plant that they made with the Chinese Chinese offer them a bunch of money to make it. And there's so many problems now with it. There's 17,000 cracks in the power plants eight turbines. This in Ecuador, a small poor country, which what a lot of cracks are like. Yeah, it's to be fair. I don't have a good. I think every time I have a crack, you crack. I actually have a quote for that. No crack is acceptable. The utility said in response to questions from the Wall Street Journal. That's the first question you want to ask. If you told me 100 cracks is chill, I would have been like, oh, that's fine. Yeah, it doesn't seem like that many crack turns out. No, you don't want any cracks in your hydropower plant. That's a lot of stuff. And this was like, so this is a huge investment for the country. This whole area, it powers like 160,000 homes that weren't powered consistently before. Great thing, except now it's potentially shutting down. And this thing costs so much money to make. The Ecuador is now in dire straits. And the president's, sorry, energy minister Fernando Santos told the media in November over my dead body will accept this poorly built plant. And so at first, they're like, this is awesome. China's coming in. They're going to help us with their expertise and their money. We're going to build all these amazing stuff. We're going to get infrastructure that we wouldn't have done otherwise. And then the quality of so many of these projects is so bad that these countries are getting extremely concerned because the problem with this whole Belt and Road Initiative is that it's not investment really. If you and I, Brandon, want to go and we want to make a power plant together. If you're, I don't know. You guys have been talking about it a little bit. We haven't talked about it. We've been off the pod. And we said crack free. Yeah, I'm going to go crack free on this one. It'll build new vision. We are going to be cracked. I'm going to be cracked, but we're going to have a crack. Yeah. Yeah. What if we had no cracks? Yeah. We could just fill it with spackle. I don't understand why it's a big deal. Duck tape. Yeah. What's the, what's the slap? Flex tape. Flex tape. Let's flex tape it. That's one of these problems. I have the Ecuadorian president talking about what he flexed him on it. Yeah. Unbelievable. I think there's just a few. Yeah. Well, this, so we're going to build a power plant. You know, right? Yeah. So we're going to build a power plant. You and me. If the way, let's say your Ecuador, the way we might do this as partners is you say, or you invest $10 billion, I China will invest $10 billion. We make it together. And then if it does well and it makes money, we're both well off, right? And it pays back our loans and we benefit into tally, right? That is normally how investment work. That's not what's going on with Belt and Road. What China is doing is loaning the money. So I'm saying, Hey, Ecuador, you historically don't have the funds for this. You don't have the tax revenue for this. I'm going to lend you billions of dollars. And then I want you to pay me and my contractors to build your power plant. And then you have to pay it all back at the end. It's just a loan. But if you don't pay it back, then I get control of the power plant. Yeah. That is how these are structured. And so from China's perspective, it's like this is great, dude. You loan money. You make them pay your contractors. So your companies and your country get a bunch of work. And then they have to pay you back. And then if they don't, you get key infrastructure in these major areas. Like for example, Sri Lanka, which is a small city south of India, they have a giant port in Colombo, which is your capital, and China loaned them money to build a new port and Hambentota, which is the south. It's like this small fishing village, right? And so China helps them build it. And nobody's really using it. And so instead of it being a co-built thing that they're doing together, like Sri Lanka is basically like, we can't fund. We can't pay you back for this stuff. And so in 2017, Sri Lanka had to give China back the port. So China just has for 100 years, they have controlling equity stake and a 100 year lease on this port, which people are now worried China is going to use as like a naval military base because it's just in the Indian Ocean, right? And on the day that China got control, the China official news agency tweeted another milestone along the path of Dalton Road. They completely fucked Sri Lanka. It's wild. I do, I do think there's merit to what you're saying. I wanted to push back a little bit because I also read about this specific port today because this is one of the ones that I've heard about in another effort a long time. Is yeah, it didn't go back to like the state which you clarified. A company has like a controlling percentage of ownership and then there's like a 99 year, they're always doing 99 year lease. 99 baby. 99. And the efficiency of the port since this takeover has gone up. But the amount of traffic that goes through this port and the amount that it's used has increased greatly since this change was made. I think it speaks to something of like, okay, well, it actually is being managed and used more effectively since then. And then if you were to give like the good faith interpretation of this, it would be that their intention in their export strategy is to create a bunch of bullet points like around this like region. So that trade is more viable in this whole region of the world, right? Yes. I do think that one of the main criticisms that has come along with this strategy in general is that these loans don't come, I mean, the loans don't come for free beyond like I'm expected to get paid back. You expect to have what you call, I don't think you'd call it hard power, right? You'd call it soft power through the influence of like giving all these countries money. And then I have kind of the push back to that, if you will, that China is all about offering these opportunities and loans at lower stakes and lower cost, not just monetarily, than the IMF is before them. Yeah, just one of the big pushbacks is like these countries would normally be going to the IMF, but it's not like the IMF is not abusing the position when they finally give these struggling countries the loans. And the argument is that it has been better for a lot of these places to take the Chinese loan for infrastructure than the IMF one. Yeah, it's been called debt trap diplomacy. And people, there's a lot of articles that are written about China side of it, but I think the IMF and the World Bank have kind of done a similar thing over the years. International, it's kind of just like countries that don't have a lot of power get, you know, they, it's like poor people with high interest credit cards and loan sharks. You know, I think countries that don't have a lot of economic heft are often getting abused by bigger public countries, regardless. I mean, that is just what it seems to be. So I agree that this is happening, but they are in a spot where they have to take a kind of a bad deal to get this infrastructure they need. So it's interesting because I think this kind of loops back to another question that I was thinking about because if I were to take, maybe my interpretation of Doug a week ago, if we were to ignore the, if we were to ignore, which is a pretty big aspect of this, the debt trap aspect of it. And I were to just say, well, isn't this build a lot and build fast strategy better than the alternative? Is it this not just a normal consequence of when you try to like create this much change in a short period of time and you're trying to build great things? Yes. Is this just not a downside of doing that? Yes. So that's why this is so interesting and it's such an interesting counterpoint to what we were talking about last week, which is build more. And again, you have on one side, America just building extremely little and China building, I would say too rapidly and too recklessly. And this is causing huge problems. It doesn't matter if you build a hydropower plant in Ecuador really fast. If it doesn't, if it doesn't stay up, right, then everybody's screwed. And so they're, they're obviously, we have to land in the middle. You should not be on the extremes and there needs to be a degree of sort of, you know, scrutiny around like how this stuff is built. It actually leads into what's happening. So the past few years, if you pull up the second article, Perry, this, so this is from Noah Smith, an article that he wrote about China dropping investing. Basically at around 2020, a few years before, their investments into new Belt and Road initiatives have plummeted. So China in response to all of these projects failing, right, of these high profile cases where it's like, hey, we helped Ecuador build a power plant. We helped you going to do this and those things failing and the government's basically being like China, you have fucked us. They're now dropping investment dramatically. And they're saying essentially, they're putting the brakes on the expansion plants and saying, we're going to become more focused on the viability of our existing projects. Is this so is this more a response of the demand for this fading or China choosing to offer it less? You're saying that the countries have been badly afflicted by these choices so many times that there's less people lining up to no, no, no, no, no. So if you go to the next one. So this is a story from Bloomberg where they talk about how there is a train and actually if you scroll the top here. So this is in Kenya. This was one of the big success stories, right? They built a train in Kenya from Mombasa, which is on the coast on the east to Nairobi, which is the capital in the middle. They didn't have that before. So this was one of the first big projects. It was lauded by the president who is saying, this is one of our big infrastructure. This is a huge deal for Kenya. This is massive and they've estimated the amount of GDP and economic activity and stimulus has done. So now if you scroll down, recently China said we're not funding anymore. So they had, if you look at the map, they had made this train track. Can you walk the last? Yeah. Well, no, the last bit is half of Kenya. I was, I was like looking at the graph and I was like, Dave, it's a long way. So this black line, they did successfully go from Mombasa to Nairobi and China said, we're going to help you fund all the way to Uganda and they were going to connect Kenya and Uganda. So there's this East African infrastructure and transit route that would really, really help these countries. Great stuff. And they've built 75 miles out of Nairobi and then China just said, no, we're done. They were supposed to give them like $4 billion more to do this and just backed out. So China is the one pulling the push. China is the one who is in response to the projects being received so badly or having so many issues or at least that's, you know, or not pay back. A lot of them, they just again, not being paid back, right? It's like it's a bad investment, right? They don't want like the Sri Lankan port. That's a strategic port for them to have. They don't need a broken hydroelectric power plant in Ecuador. They're not getting paid back for the president's saying they're not going to pay it. That's not helpful. So that's just lost money. We don't, we have to assume what China, the reason, you know, they're just saying, we're going to tighten our belt. We're going to focus on the availability of existing projects. That's, that's kind of what they're saying. I mean, this all ties in. I mean, this is the same impulse they had to over build in the country. They had that building area where they were just, everything was funded through building. And when that sort of stopped working, they made this massive pivot to fuck it. We're going all in on exports. Yes. And that is why we're in, that's, you know, everything has a consequence. Now we're in the area where they're, they're dominating global exports and everyone's pushing back, especially the United States. Yeah. And so everything leads to each other thing. So this, so this, so what you're saying is that this approach, like these type of projects don't necessarily map very well to the current strategy. They're current strategy. No, I don't think. I think it did for about 12 years. It mapped their thing of we are just going to build immensely. And then the past couple years, unlike some of the other parts of their, their economy, they're saying we are going to pull back from just mass infrastructure as a way of getting ourselves out of these problems. So they are pulling back from built and road as a major global initiative. And it, to me, it's like, okay, as much as I want to sit here and rant about, we should build nonstop build constantly. This is a real cautionary tale of like it matters if you build shitty stuff. Like this is totally absolutely crippling some of these economies. Like Kenya now is trying to go around raising $3.6 billion from all these different private companies, right? Like they're, this is like a disaster for them. And they just have this, all these plans that are done now. And yeah, it's, it's bad. Yeah, I mean, if you go to like a Ken or I don't know if Kenya, but Central African country now or if you go to Kazakhstan now or you go to the countries where there used to be trying to build power plants or, or railroads, what they're doing now is they're selling you B.Y.D. cars. They're selling them. They're just exploring it. Like that's what, that's their new way. What it was, we are going to build infrastructure in China and around the world. That's our way to get out of our problems. And as that has been failing the past few years, it's now we're just going to build an absolutely obscene amount of stuff in China and sell it to the entire organ of it. Everybody else in the world is going to buy it. Well, because one of my thoughts with this is when you said they were pulling back on this, I was like, Oh, is this soft power strategy maybe fading away? Maybe that was never as big of a part of it as I thought or had been reported because there it seems to be very much about money and not getting paid back on these loans and then deciding not to do this anymore. But if you're the exporter of all goods to the rest of the world, you also exert a different kind of a different kind of soft power in that way. And people end up falling in line for like different reasons. So that it's very, very interesting. It's I just is, I said it. We got to be somewhere in the middle. That's, that's the crazy thing that I assume everybody agrees. I'm not going to get the bill. It's Mr. Middle of the road. Robots looks like we need to find a compromise. Yeah, fucking win and election on that one, Doug. Anyway, I think building responsibly and affordably is good. If it doesn't cause any problems. And we've done it again. We've done it again. Folks, lemonade stand does it again. So thank you for watching this week's episode of lemonade stand. We'll be back next week with 60 different updates on how the tariffs changed again. And honestly, you guys can, we could do a little leak. It's not a big announcement, but maybe a little leak. We're going to be launching a Patreon alongside the show. A lot of people have been asking a discord community to engage in. You're going to be able to give more feedback on stories or things that we talk about in the episodes. You'll be able to submit stories as possibilities of what we talk about on the show. We're going to be doing a book club every month and doing some additional episodes intended with the book club following up to comments. And the main benefit, a bonus hour of the show every week. So yeah, should be hype. And every single Patreon sub, Doug, Doug, we need a lemon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Full lemon on camera and Aiden will. What are you going to do? I just doubled down on the lemon thing. Yeah, Korean. If you want to be honest with you, if you're, you will adopt a Korean child. The problem is if Doug is dead set on the lemon thing and he's the one who eats it every time, he's going to die within the next two years. So we better. That's what you've been spreading out. And we can't stop the word. That's a Korean show. So many patrons. This is how we fund it. We will do. There's at least 1000 people who want me to die from lemons. I don't, I don't want you to die. Get into the discord. So you can hurt my feelings more closely to me. Really just dig in, you know, I need to, I can't be in this chair forever. I need you to take back up the mental side. I'll be back. Don't worry next week. I'll do it. I was going to drop. Gollum and you're saying, you can't, you can't, you can't. Next week, who's down? Crypto week. I actually crash out. All right. Thank you. You got a watchy lemonade. Same one. See you next week. Crypto week is canceled.\\n\\nCheers. Cheers. Cheers. Oh my god. Woo! Alright, it's your podcast. Oh damn! We got our topics for today. I believe we're kicking it off with a Refresh Aiden talking about Japan housing. Oh, it's going on. What's going on in Japan, Aiden? Alright, well I did just get back from Japan. Yep. And I thought it would be nice to pick, you know, a nice exciting topic related to Japan. And one thing that was going through my head a lot while I was there because we actually went out into the countryside. And I've never done that before. I've been, or at least not in like mainland Japan. I've been to Hokkaido and I've done a little road trip like while it's snowing. And I've been to Tokyo. But I've never been into like the countryside that you kind of see. Do you consider yourself a long-awaited Hong Kong? You're a big head. We were calling, nicking like the chop-huzz the entire time, if you know what that means. In Japanese, the whole time we were there, we'll move on from that. Anyway, I think it'll be a big head line that I have seen in our median recent years is about how you can get three houses in Japan. Anyone can buy one. Literally one or zero dollar homes. And the catch being that these homes are often like very, you know, broken down, old, abandoned. But it did make me want to look a little more into like why housing in Japan is so relatively cheap at a time when like everywhere in the world, right? Like developed countries, big cities, prices of real estate are generally going up. Like people are getting priced out of living places. And that's not like an American thing necessarily. I can't Australia. It's all over the world. Yes. So the first thing I took a look at was as you've explained to me in the past is Japan had this gigantic asset bubble that like largely included real estate. When they were when their economy was exploding, they went through this huge inflationary period of assets in the country. And then I think it was in like 99, 90, 90, two was like that when it like really, really crashed. They'd peaked in 89. So look at a fun step. Yeah. In 89, the peak of the bubble, the land around the Imperial Palace in Tokyo was worth more than all the real estate in California. Like you could own California for less than. They had the one of the biggest real estate bubbles in human history is crazy. Wow. We stated a hotel right next to the Imperial Palace and have you considered that it's really nice? Yeah. This is your trading for California with Royal Union. And if you're starting, it's not that nice. It's just not as good as the Imperial Palace. And one like little video I watched as an example is even on the outskirts of Tokyo, which is like a, you know, a major, major city, right? The most popular city in the world by like metro area population on the outskirts of Tokyo. There are large like, you know, 1500 square foot family homes that might cost like $70,000. And compared to, you know, what we would be paying in LA. That's great. You could. You could be a part in LA for Sprite. I believe the median price for a home in LA is like 1.1 million. Yeah, I think it passed the median. Yeah. Oh my god. That's what I heard too. I don't know what you're going to look at the exact amount. But I know because it was a comparison. It was actually from the book abundance by Ezra Klein, which we'll probably talk about next week, but talking about how the price of a home in America is just a scenely overpriced, at least in most of the like blue cities right now. The metro areas. Right. The metro areas. Yeah. So there's a bunch of factors and I'll kind of layer this into two main things that I saw. So for rural Japan, where you could get these abandoned houses, right? There is a decline in population. Like as time has passed, really concentrated movement of people from rural areas of Japan into cities, just like a lot of the developed world is going through in general, right? Like that's a general population movement that happens, but Japan it happened earlier and more aggressively. And that on top of that really low birth rate really low. And one of the lowest in the world on top of this, Japan also isn't really changed its mind about immigration, at least not at a rate that matters. Like they're not welcoming in or making big efforts to get large amounts of foreigners in the country to sort of supplement the population, right? So I real caught on that. So I looked into a little bit on their immigration changes. Yeah. My understanding is it used to basically be zero. Like nobody comes in. This is Japan only. And then the past few years they've opened it up a lot. But are you saying that a lot is just relatives? It's not increasing in any meaningful way. And I asked a friend while we were there who's lived there for a long time. Like what is young people's perspective on letting more immigrants in to like help deal with these problems? And this applies to a lot of issues, not just like immigration housing or like whatever economic problems Japan is dealing with. He said young people and people in Japan in general are just very, very apathetic about politics. It isn't something you publicly engage in in general. And I think it's part of a general cultural like way of like how people socialize. It'd be very weird for you to talk to strangers about your honest opinions about things in the first place. But then decoupling from that, I think politics is like particularly sensitive. And there isn't a culture of being attentive and involved in politics in the way that it dominates discussion in America in particular. But maybe the West in a larger sense. And so basically in the rural areas, they're dealing with this problems like their supply is like increasing just by proxy of it not being used anymore. Right. And because there's no demand and nobody is moving to these rural areas, it basically just boils down to that. And because of that, you have these really low home prices, like even a nice thing on the outside, like the, I think the misleading part of the freehouse is that those ones aren't nice. It's like they aren't well kept. You would have to put a lot of work into it. There are stories of Americans because foreigners can buy property in land in Japan freely. There's like no restrictions on that. Forders can buy those properties and there are stories of for instance, Americans going and getting one of these free homes. But the amount of work that you have to put into it to make it like live environment. But I heard you can't buy it unless you move there. You can't, I couldn't like make an investment. I think for the free ones, my loose understanding is for that specific program. Yeah. That gives out the free ones you do. But if we were buying, if we wanted to buy that $70,000 apartment or the $50,000, like a $30,000 apartment, we would be able to buy that. Or like the land doesn't come with like a permanent residence. You buy the property, but it's not like you can just roll into Japan and you live there now. Yeah. So you still have to go through the arduous process of getting approved for a visa and then permanent residency, which is usually 10 years of living there. My friend who immigrated there was talking about how if he got kicked out, he wouldn't lose the asset of like the home, you know, or the land. I see. So you go there for six months. So all I have to do is keep going there every six months and add to my housing portfolio. I don't even know if he is on the black. In general, in general, I think like I said, I think the rules might be different for those like free or like near free homes. But if you were just buying like a home that a nice big home that was like pretty expensive in Tokyo, like you could just buy that and not live there. Right. You guys want to buy like a $1 home in the countryside and do an episode there. It's just the one time studio. That would be so sick for the podcast. Just our Japan studio. No, but I was already thinking so big. Yeah. On this small town and they're like, we're dying and we're running out of people. And then we have three new immigrants that are coming up and turning things around and we show off for one. What? They're calling a bottle of ice. They're just dunking our faces in ice water and then we leave. You've lost the bottle of the ground and then I will. Yeah. But yeah, that's so much. That's like Logan Paul round two for sure. I saw a few things that just related to the countryside stuff that are interesting because I was just looking into this a little bit. Apparently 647 of Japan's towns and villages have been designated as depopulated areas. 60% of Japan, the land area, is now depopulated areas where it's like there are not enough people there and they're basically losing support. And then it's part of that. So all these people just over the past 20 years that spend this, I mean, decades, but it's increased, I guess, even more in the last 20 years that all these people moving for the countryside to the city, right? And so then the railroads in the countries are having to close stations. So JR Hokkaido closed 18 stations. This was last year. I believe 2024. It would be due to low passenger demand. JR West is why America was smart to do no trade. No trade. We got it. We figured it out. We knew there'd be a crisis. That way we would be having a pay. We're really planning for that. We're long-term thinkers. And then this, like really kind of mind fucked me. A shift from trains to buses doesn't work because some 40% of the vehicular bridges in Japan are reaching age 50 and the local governments don't have the budget to repair them. So they're just forced to ban their use. And so, countrysides are also becoming less accessible as the bridges are no longer becoming usable. And then there isn't the people or the budget to repair them. So the countryside, it's like this spiral. So yeah, you can go get one of these, you know, $10,000 houses, but it might be hours away by car from a train station. So I'm in a Japan expert. Why did they simply use the mechs or the mechs to do that? Oh, is that not, well, in the budget or was it? Well, Britannia is still winning the war. Most of them are in contact right now. It's tough. Once Japan is in peacetime, the mechs will return home and they will build the bridges. You know what's interesting is not just Japan. So I looked at this too. Italy is going through pretty much bar for bar the same way. Really? There are a little more open immigration, but like you can get a $0, $1 house in Italy in the countryside where anything outside of the city, it's like they're having aging population with not enough young people people are leaving the small towns. If you go live there, they'll basically give you your house for free. So I was going to bring up that trend as well because my friend showed me this in Sweden. Rural areas in Sweden. It's the same thing. You get a pretty nice large home and like a rural part of Sweden for maybe like 30 to 50,000 dollars in like pretty good condition, lovely location and same, same mechanisms behind it basically just like everybody needs to move or wants to move to the city. So like for an average person, that's not a good deal still because you're so isolated and the town is dying. But I'm wondering when someone's going to flip and people are going to move as flocks. Like if you had eight of your friends and all your, their families are well, you all decide you were just going to take over the small town. This is this is the get insane real estate. This is the LA influencer problem that we talk about. How a bunch of people in LA that do you guys describe? I hate Los Angeles for the record. Nine out of 10 people that I have talked to I probably talked to 30 or 40 content creators in LA about this have said, oh, I hate LA. I'm only here because everybody else is here. Exactly. But all of us say that and nobody leaves. But everybody has to move out on me. Yes. Because it's all you've been in the same place. There's your there's a few people. You're the. He's not an attention. Nine out of 10 dentists. You're the dentists saying that the toothpaste doesn't work. Yeah, you're the toothpaste. You already teeth. I'm up and then appeals on your teeth. I use this. Yeah. And I use a mouth tape and my teeth are pearly. But I do think it's really interesting that that this is like up so a pair of it in other countries as well because that gets talked about less. Yeah. Japan is the country that has the headlines so often. I think because it's the problem is so much more aggressive and it's been building for longer. Yeah. And then the other part of this that I wanted to talk about was, okay, well, rural areas, right? We're talking about in Japan people moving to cities like Tokyo, for instance. Sure. But Tokyo is really interesting too because compared to other cities in the world with like I would say equal standing in development. If you look at a city like London or New York or Clancyville, you would you would see that Tokyo is relatively affordable compared to those places, which is really, really interesting. Like why is this major city not going through the same real estate struggle that all those other big cities are. And because obviously in Tokyo, like in Japan, the rural areas population is declining. But Tokyo, the population is still going up. Yeah, in this sense. Okay. Yeah. And the big thing behind this is their zoning and building laws. They have a way different approach to like how housing is allowed to be built in a different culture of expectations around how you judge or value the homes, homes next to you. So they were starting to go through a similar like cost of living crisis in the 60s as they were developing. So they put in a place a new zoning law at that time that like in America, there's for zoning laws, we have like hundreds of different types of zones and like weight and different rules to move around with it. But Tokyo only has 12 different types of zones that properties can be ending like 10 of those 12 housing is allowed to be built in all of them. So if it's zoned for like retail, if it's zoned for something else, you can still build housing in that area alongside it. And that's created like an industry and a supply of housing that is always outpacing actual households. Yeah, so a graph that was like it showed New York and then it layered over it. What buildings that are there now wouldn't be allowed to be built under current zoning laws. So 40% of the exist right now wouldn't be allowed to be built today. This was really shocking the way it's been zone. You can only build high scale luxury apartments. You can only build like the highest end stuff you can't build. Yeah, I think that was really surprising because to me in an American context, right. New York is pretty dense. There's a lot of there is a lot of like apartment style housing there that doesn't exist in like a lot of other cities. But even a place like New York has really. The American one right basically those zones have like reached their capacity. And then okay, well, you might think let's vote to change the zoning laws. Let's change these things in order to get more housing built. And this is also something that was really interesting to me because in America, right. We vote for these things at the local level. And that's what kind of like the idea of an imbiism comes in like not in my backyard. Basically, if I own property in a place. Yeah. I don't in order to maintain the growth of the value of the property that I already own, I'm going to vote against new housing initiatives in my area. Maybe under the guise of like keeping the culture of the neighborhood or something, right. And so housing initiatives are consistently struck down. But in Japan, that housing that those zoning laws are just set at the national level. They just decide. That's interesting. So people in neighborhoods don't have the same. Control over control. It gets to build in there. That's super interesting. And the result also like for one more example of this is in America, oftentimes there will be rules about the standardization of like how a house is built in a new development. So there's reasons why like why groups of homes like have to match up with each other or have similar designs or require similar like lawn care or something like that. Might be through your HOA. It might be like a city ordinance. But in Japan, there's no culture of that. And so you know like rules on how you can build your apartment or home next to the home next to you. It doesn't have like there, there's no worry about the design of your home devaluing the design of the property next to yours. Which is also this goes in tandem with one last interesting piece that plays into this is there is a strong culture of breaking down homes and rebuilding when you buy. So moving into somebody's home that was already owned and lived in is like weirdly not cool in Japan. And it's way more common to get the home break it down and then build a new home. I saw I saw a number for this. That's crazy in 2013. Guess the number. Okay, of all home purchases in Japan. How many of them are purchasing somebody pre-built home, right? Versus a you get a brand new one. Wait, pre-built versus brand new. As in you buy a used home. Yeah, like in America. And move it. Yeah, for the most part, people buy homes that you go like the vast majority of the time is a house that's built into its for sale. And now you buy that house. Yeah, I would say 75% or pre-built. Only 15% of all house purchases in Japan were of existing houses the rest that they create new homes. That's 85% of people and they buy a home are making a new home there. They either destroy the old one or they just get a new one built and do that. And even the one guy I know in Japan who is getting who's making he's making a home like building it from scratch. You bought the plot and that's just crazy because like the vast majority in Europe, United States, whenever like homes are meant to be this appreciating assets. Forever in Japan, it's like this temporary thing that is not meant to appreciate. I didn't know that until I looked into this. Like I the common practice of like breaking those things down. I think there's also a part of this where the homes and the land that they're built on are actually owned separately. Yeah. So it is most common like if I were a homeowner in Japan, most homeowners in Japan. If you like if you own an actual like home and not an apartment own the land the home is built on. That is like the most common situation. But technically those things are disconnected. So you might lease the land itself own the home that's built on it and pay like a rental fee to the land. Which is which is something that happens. Interesting. And yeah, so I. Wait, what if I own a home on a land that I'm leasing then someone else buys the land from underneath me and say, I don't want you to have a home here anymore. Yeah, they just know they can't. Okay, so I don't think they can. You're saying if if the landowner like you're going to have a house. Yes, I'm going to want to hurt you. So I'm going to buy the land underneath your home and then tell you to get kick rocks. Yeah, it's called freehold versus leasehold. So leasehold is you own the building, but you rent the land. Yeah. And so there's situations where you buy the property, the home on the land, you don't own the land. Yeah. And if that lease, but you usually get the lease for like decades, but if the lease ends and after 30 years of living there in this house, they don't want to renew the lease with you. You then have to leave and they can destroy the home. Which is usually what happens because again, it sounds like they are just constantly taking down building and. Interesting. And re like rebuilding them. And I think this part of this part of this like culture of like rebuilding and building in general is a huge part of like why supply has like managed to be so bound to fall in a place like this and like why they're not dealing with the same housing crisis. Yeah, it's tough. They have other economic crises in Japan that are that are oncoming, right? But in comparison to like if you looked at a city like Sydney or Vancouver or New York, it's way, way different and you'd expect Tokyo to be in a similar position to those places. Right. Yeah. I mean, the best example I saw in a country not necessarily going through the exact same demographic crisis, which Japan is so it's hard to disentangle them because there's a population is shrinking every year. So it's like houses are going to get cheaper regardless. But in like Austin, America, they changed their zoning laws to build more and rents have been dropping dramatically, like down 22%. Yeah, Austin is like the success story in the United States right now. Like, oh, if you build a lot of housing, even while the city population has been skyrocketing over the past five years, houses go, housing prices go down. Yeah, you just have to let people build stuff. So very pro build stuff. Just build build more houses. Yeah, I've dug, dug will build your house. If I hit look, I feel like I'm just dropping these random facts about Japan. I learned and I'm going to drop one more. So I guess that supposedly part of the thinking, but between why Japan has this culture of like just destroying houses and rebuilding them is because it was the post war era. A lot of Japan was destroyed right. So what they needed was a ton of prefabricated housing that wasn't meant to last forever. It was just get housing up. But then that created this culture and this system where you have all of this industry that's built around homes that aren't meant to last 100 years like ours are. But they're just meant to be there for 20, 30 years. You just have a place to live. But then after 30 years, the whole thing is brought down. And so that consists. So the value of the home and the land are separate, right. And so if you buy a home and land together in Japan, the home is meant to go to zero value over 30 years. It is like a car. It's a depreciating asset. The home you buy is just like a car and it is going to zero over time. Or if not zero, like $10,000 in the country, right. That's why it's a totally different mindset than what we have, which is like homes go up in value. It's an investment in Japan. And so they're like, no, that's my old shitty car that's 30 years old. Why would some foreigner want to come into the country and buy it? Like what are you doing? Go build a new home. It's like that's the culture. Well, so there is an asterisk. When I was there talking to a few people about this, the asterisk on pricing that I noticed is for the for the average person, right. Like if you were just a working class person who lives in an apartment, renting is more affordable. And that's and that's cool. But if you're a person who is looking to buy a plot of land and build a home on it. Yes. In a place like Tokyo, the combined cost of those two things is a very expensive and comparable to a place like Los Angeles. So it's sort of like it's a little misleading to say that housing, like house ownership is that much cheaper because if you wanted to go the full distance. Yeah, in a place like Tokyo that has that demand. If you want the housing experience that we think of in the west, that is different last, fat, and then I'll stop driving, dropping. Okay. Okay. No, these are good. The average building in large, expensive, urban areas of Japan, the actual building is only about 10% of the cost of the whole thing. So you're like 90% of what you're buying is the land, not the building on top of it. Yeah. And again, if you're like, oh, rents really cheap, it's like, well, if you want to also buy the plot of land, you're paying like nine times as much. In the most extreme cases, but crazy. It's a totally different system. Yeah, I think the concept of it, because again, like the idea that you have a whole system built around getting a lot of homes up quickly. And you can just get things made that somebody can at a very low entry point, get into a plot of land and have a cheap home built. And then in longer term, they can look for actually getting the land and having this appreciating asset. That feels great. We bundle them together in the west, and then you have to go all in on this plot plus house. And it doesn't, doesn't make sense. And then objectively, we're failing at it, but maybe it's a zoning. I don't know. The outlook on, it's interesting to see the spectrum of outlook on housing because it seems like in this situation, your house is not, your house is basically not an asset. It's not something you're investing in. Yeah. And then further down the line, maybe a little more in the middle would be like the American way of looking at things where it's like your house is an investment, but you diversify and you put a lot of money into like stocks and bonds and stuff like that. And then there's like on the other end, I feel like China where it's like do or die by property. They still recently, yeah, it was like always on until the until the crash. Yeah. Do you know about this? There's some giant percentage of Americans were almost their entire investment is in their home. Like they don't. This is why this is the reason, you know, America and Canada and Australia and all these countries. It's impossible problem or a thorny problem to fix is because for so many years now, if you will have been told, this is how you almost safer retirement. This is what you're saying for you put your money into this 30 year mortgage and you're paying on. And then when you retire, it's worth a lot more and you can sell it and have a life. If you were to turn homes into appreciating assets overnight, which I think is like kind of what you have to do to get to a real society. It cripples like a generation of people. There's young Canadians who have taken out the biggest loans imaginable to buy a house in their area and like. Yeah, I mean that's the problem. It's like with the crippled. And then you know, I think it's something like the local zoning stuff like why would you be a nimbi? It's like in, you know, a lot of people, the idea behind nimbias is like in principle, you agree with the idea of more affordable housing. But it's a not in my backyard because it's against your own individual interest about for at least in the short term. Yeah. I like it. I think you could make a long, long term argument that you're also voting against your own interest. I mean, I like the idea of taking it out of people's and I think people, you know, people talk shit about new people all the time and I get it. But it's hard to make someone vote against their own personal pocketbook. Yeah, you need to change like the structure. Yeah, I like what you said about Japan where it's just a federal thing. It's like everyone's doing it. It's not just your little area. You're gonna fall behind. Yeah. Everyone's gonna have a devaluation in some way to make it more affordable for. So everyone doesn't get angry. I mean, I feel like I seriously feel like I say this a lot, but I feel like half of global radicalization is due to an inability of young people to afford a home or even a path of putting on. I think if everyone could afford a home that would change so much of people's. Yeah, and incredibly. There are so many problems that stem from a culture where housing is meant to be your main investment because it's like we said it's just it incentivizes everything for you to prevent housing to be built. Once you bought into the system every incentive pushes you towards less housing being built and it screws over everybody who isn't already in the system. And it's like so now we're dealing with that and I I'm pessimistic about how we change this and that's why I like I hear the the Japanese Japan on the national level deciding zoning and that just sounds like a. Fantasy to me of like God if you could just force all these people to just build and just not even force them to build to let developers build like San Francisco does everything they can to stop developers who desperately want to make housing from doing it because they come in and just stop every single thing at every point of the way. And if you just opened the market and let people build things housing would go down but they're all every homeowner in San Francisco benefits from the fact that the prices go up every year right and it's just yeah. I don't know how we solve it is actually in the book that just came out which will probably talk about the next couple weeks that this is very explicitly what they're talking about as one of the main issues right now that is causing particularly blue states to lose people to red states in the United States because it is just not affordable cost of living cost of housing right and red states are on average building a lot more in Texas and Florida are particularly doing that they are gaining the most people their housing prices are the most affordable it's like something has to give like we people can't do this. I don't know man it's it's tough is I think once you try to if you tried to pass some sort of like national legislation about it right depending on who's making the effort to pass it the messaging is kind of similar to the version of getting rid of cars that I didn't actually say. I heard from the comments he did. I heard from the comments he did. So but that's the I think in America like as soon as you overstep the boundary of something that affects property rights people are going to light up about it the messaging about it will never be delivered in like a positive like this is what the country or community needs it will always be an infraction on like. Yeah it goes back to American culture of freedom and government get out of our like why would the net the federal governments come in and tell my town that we have the build more and can't zone the way we want to and then on top of that part it's exacerbated by the fact that who votes the most old people right the order you get the more you involve your local politics the more power you have in your local politics and those are the people who are bought into the homing system and do not want everybody else to come in and allow a bunch of apartment buildings to spread all over the place. So also the people who have the most voting power are the most incentivized and young people aren't going to coalesce around this enough to do it. I mean maybe they will maybe they're also by I mean people are getting more and more restless about it. It's like one of the biggest problems. Yes. And maybe it's a breaking point and I would love it to go. We all move to Japan countryside. That's where we move all the other streamers like look we found a shack in Hokkaido and the bridge just broke down but like we can jump the ditch like in did the Canada we can rebuild the days that we have fun stream. We're rebuilding infrastructure live stream. Just to sign this topic off I thought it was funny because Nick England came as our like producer for this trip and he said as we were walking around Tokyo it'd be so nice if we just had big ass buildings like that that we're just housing. Why don't we have that. I saw him getting radicalized on trains. It was so funny. He we're on the flight back home and he was like why do I have to get in this fucking chungus Uber. It's making sense. Alex will radicalize it will. Alex is a little different. If you fly from Tokyo. Yeah, you take a train to Tokyo's airport fly to LA act you get out into LA X and take an Uber to your $1 million. Take a bus to your parking lot to take your parking lot. $1 million home that you don't own but you rent for five K a month. It's like damn man. Oh housing annoys me so much. So yeah, I thought that was just something interesting to sign the trip off on but I want to hear about why woke is killing movies brand. Because you can go and you can't be radical about how movies and games are woke. Okay, let's just simplify for the audience. You have to watch the whole thing. Is Japan woke or not? That's my presentation. We're going to go into it. I'm talking about. I am basically going through everything in the world and say woke or not. Okay. Okay, good. Finally, find the podcast. Yeah, I would look at the podcast are most successful in us and they talk about woke a lot. Yeah, I would really throw our hat and the ring. Unfortunate that if we were following the model of success, that probably would be the way. I always talk about the movie industry. So you know, we live in Los Angeles. It's pretty important to the economy here. And I wanted to learn more about it. As you may or may not know, a movie just came out called Snow White. Boom. Wait, hold on. Are we booing or cheering for this? You guys still let me know. Snow White was the first movie they made, right? Wasn't that Disney's first feature length? I believe so. Yeah. Yeah. Before they were like, before it turns out now that it's woke, it's gone broke. Is this good or should I be cheering for you? Or whatever. Whatever your heart says, 43 million opening weekends. Very low for a $270 million budget. Weak opening, worry some for Disney. And the natural response that I'm seeing on the internet is that Snow White has gone woke. Snow White has gone woke and that is why this movie is flopping. And that is the main thing to blame. And of course, I believe that instantly because it aligns with my entire worldview. So I'm locked in, but I thought I would look into it more. And as I looked into it, I discovered really that we were at a real precipice, a real interesting time in the movie business, especially here in Los Angeles, especially here in America. That is, it's changing rapidly under our feet. And I want to talk about it more. So Snow White, while doing terribly across the board box office wise, actually outperformed in red states. So possibly, possibly is not 100% entirely on the, the woke backlash. And it could be more having to do with the fact that it's not woke enough for the blue stage. It's not woke enough. Oh, damn. Or maybe Doug, it's possible that the lackluster performance of Snow White and Mickey 17 and dogman and Captain America are not entirely on a woke, not woke spectrum. Maybe that's affecting some people's ticket sales. You guys are shaking your heads. I understand. Maybe I got to get this more. You keep saying something that makes a no sense. This is a podcast. It's possible that the entire industry is going through some bigger problems. The 225 box office off to a terrible start. Not just Snow White, but every movie released this year is off to a pretty bad start. And we're way down from last year, which was already a bad year. It's like 50% ticket sales in March are down from last year and last year was a bad. These are, I assume mostly like theater box office, right? This theater box office. Okay. Which I don't know if you'll get to this, but I assume streaming and competition. Big part of this. We'll talk about stream. It's about the movie industry. Is there still like movie theater movie? Like movie theater industry in a way, right? And like Hollywood studio productions, right? Right. And the whole system. Yeah. It's falling apart. They're selling less than ever. So is the problem supply or demand? That's kind of what I'm going to go through today. Is it that there's not enough good movies? Or is it that people aren't learning to watch movies? Or is it some combination of both? Let's go through this. Okay. I'm sure there's no nuance to this. In the comments, we'll let us know there's no nuance. Do these box office flops, including Mickey 17 here, which turns out was not. Whoa. But still flopped. They spill the end of Hollywood. And first thing people say is COVID. People will say, well, it's reaction to COVID ever since COVID. People aren't going to movies as much. It's a COVID thing. I look at that too. It turns out like every other out of home entertainment thing. Like, for example, Broadway, sports, concerts, and the top right. We have people going to a live D&D show. These are up. They've recovered from COVID. And they are now up in sales. They've trended back upwards. Movie theaters are these. The only one of like out of home experiential type things that are still declining. So there's something unique happening in this industry. I want to take it back to 24. I'll go back to last year. We're going to look at last year's box office and just get an idea. First of all, the supply issue. Have we considered that D&D might not be woke? Impossible. None of those will only movies are woke. D&D has famously purged. Whoa. Yeah, there's no. I know what that is. I'm going to go back to the first one. I'm going to go back to the first one. I'm going to go back to the first one. I'm going to go back to the first one. I'm going to go back to the first one. I'm going to go back to the first one. I've been purged. Whoa, yeah. There's no. I know what the D&D all those circles famously right winged in and out. Well, the Dark Elves merged all the dark D&D's all white right wing. Finally, finally 8- We're going to start at the 13th best performing movie of the year. I want you to see as I go through, as I count up, if you notice anything about these movies. So this is Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the sequel to a 80s classic that did pretty well. This is gladiator 2, it's the sequel to a 2000 classic that did pretty well. Uh-oh. This is Venom the last dance. It is a third part of a trilogy of Venom movies that are part of a larger spider verse that Sony owns. That's part of a larger Marvel verse. Okay? This is Sonic 3. This is Kung Fu Panda 4. This is Godzilla Kong the new Empire. The fifth in the monster verse, but the 39th Godzilla movie. This is due to it. It's pretty cool. I don't know. We got. Oh, the whole. Whoa. The movie comes for the record. This one ripped. It's got a ripped. Still a sequel. Okay. What kind of ripped? Move fossil aligned King, a CGI remake of an animated movie. It's a prequel. Very necessary. Very equal to the animated one or the live action. It's a prequel. Well, they call it live action, but it's all computer. Are these? Well, he's just destroyed so many studios. Look at the pattern. Is that the pattern, I'm seeing? I mean, look how woke this Bufasa line is. Well, they're, you feel real tigers. Yeah, they're real. I'm the original Lion King. I'm beginning to notice the trend here. Are you noticing the following? Despicable me for. Oh, my. And then, and then we have wicked. Well, now wicked. We're wicked. Is wicked is of all these 13 movies I shown. I guess an original property, but it's based on a Broadway play, which is based on the 1939. Wizard of Oz movie, which is based on the most, one of the most popular movies of all time. And this is not an original property. But it is the first movie I could even call remotely not a sequel. Oh, what I've shown. Sure. Super. Which is good. But that's where fighting to say that. This is trying to fight this. Yeah. Okay. And we have Milana to Disney back to the well, Deadpool and Wolverine. Remember Logan? You guys see Logan? Yeah. Really emotional, powerful ending for the Wolverine. Maybe more Wolverine. And then they said, let's bring him back. Yeah. Bring him back. Cause there's more money to be made. Logan is so good. It was such an amazing. And the so undercut. And it's back. And then we have the number one movie that you're inside out to where they added more emotions to tell more of the story. And this did really well. One of the biggest enemies of all time. I don't know if you saw a pattern from all of the top 13 highest grossing films in the world last year. But I think customers are seeing a pattern. I think they're starting to feel a little bit of fatigue from constant sequels and reimagining of the exact same stories. And I went back to make sure I wasn't crazy here. And this is 1999. What am I favorite movie years growing up? This is again, the top 13. I picked the ones that aren't sequels and you'll notice it's a majority of them. You got the sixth sense. You got the major. You got big daddy. You got green mile. And they're not all CGI. They're not all, you know, family action comedies. They're like a broad mix. We have there is a couple Julia Roberts. She has she's overrepresented. 99, but there's a horror movie. There's a comedy movie. There's Stuart Little. There's a big mix. And even for the zoomers, I know Aiden is 12 years old. I went to 2006. And it's the same kind of thing. 2006 movies you grew up with. There's a lot of new IP here. Starting with the quick verse. I just started. And it was what today? Today if click hits the top 10, there would be a click to click three. Click verse. You know what I'm saying? True. We're in a different era. So things have dramatically changed. And studios have gotten more and more safe. If we were to, I mean, if we were to just look at the movies on this screen right now, we were joking about click to, right? Yeah. But these are like original properties that came out at this time. And then a lot of these did get a bunch of sequels like over the hedge, cars, happy feet, all got. You're right. Yeah. And those are movies that have come out in the 2010s and all in the era where this like trend, I feel like kind of started. The departed didn't get a sequel. So that's kind of weird. Did you watch the departed? Not a room for a sequel. No, no for a sequel. I just feel what? It's a bit of a Logan situation. No. We couldn't get part of it. Oh, you knew we could get Deadpool into part. I would love a departed verse. Okay. So anyway, you can see. You can see that Disney, but not only Disney, all these major studios have begun playing it safe. Investors are noticing, consumers are noticing, people are afraid, first of all, in a declining sales environment to lose their job. So they only want to green light movies that they know will be a success. And now we're getting to like, four, five, six, the parts of the Caribbean series is just long dead and they're stomping on its grave because they're trying to recapture the magic of like a 2003, first time seeing Johnny Depp. Yeah, what's up? Teacher, I have a question. Okay. How much do you think, which is maybe what you'll get into of that, the fact that last year, the top 13 movies were all sequels, which is insane. Do you feel like that maybe it's that people do really like sequels, not that they're getting tired of it, right? Is it like those were the ones that were the most successful 13 movies. So maybe it's like, this is what audiences actually want. When are you going to do that? There's a huge argument to that in that it is working, but less and less effective. It's exactly. It's following. We're following down the drain. That's exactly what I was thinking of, right? Is like the repetition of the formula is slowly like think about sequels in the 2010s sort of era and how year after year after year, box office record getting broken, right? And now we're kind of hitting the fatigue where it's enough to get some people going, but we're peering off. The broad industry is not struggling. And because this is like the majority of movies, movies coming out, I feel like less original films have the chance to be the next big hit or franchise or something like that. I mean, they simply are getting made in the first place. Outside of streaming services. Yeah. In terms of box office, they are not putting them in theaters because they're too risky. So we know that there's a supply problem. People are at least in somewhat getting fatigued with the same thing over and over. But there's also, as you are going to bring up a demand problem, you can just see a long amount of people talking about how their consumption habits have changed around movies, which is that streaming services and the ease of being at home have changed their ability and end COVID in some way, change their buying habits of like actually going to a theater. It thought it was a temporary phase. It's not and they're spending more and more time watching things at home where it's cheaper, easier. And some people are sad about that movie going is not what it used to be and it's leading to a shrinking pie that is being filled only with sequels and safe problems. But there's also one other aspect of the demand that I want to bring up, which is that maybe older people are leaning more into their home, but they're still watching a lot of movies. However, among younger people, especially younger than us, they're choosing our content. They're watching lemonade stand instead of going to the movie or they're watching it. I show speeders. I mean, that's the two. Never mind. Never mind. Let's okay. Despicable me. Five. Push it out. I don't care. Moana 10. Keep it coming. Whatever keeps us watching. So they're choosing creator content over premium TV and movies. YouTube is one of the biggest threats to the movie industry because even if they're not as high budget or as well thought out, it's exactly your niche. Whatever you as a person wants, someone's going to make a 30 minute, 20 minute video exactly that for you for free. And it's really crowding out the ability of Hollywood to make what they used to make. If you think of Gen Z and 40% of millennials find social media content and then includes YouTube, more relevant, traditional TV or movies. And they feel a stronger personal connection, social media creators than TV personalities, which we monetize. So the last thing I want to say, that's the demand side. We talk about supply side. The last thing I want to say that's really interesting about Hollywood and the movie industry right now is DJing Ping. He's a great actor. He's going to be shaking things up. He's he woke for no. Oh, he's the focus they get. Nobody's. All right. Nobody's won't be in classic G. Gen Ping because you're talking about chat, Jim, you later, I use the new filter they added to make him do these kind of rips. Wow. I like like him more. He's probably do these. I would let him lead me. Yeah. Anyway, so G. So the 14th movie last year, I said the 13 right? The one right below that was this movie in China called YOLO. And it's an entirely original movie about a woman who's down on her luck who takes up boxing and it's a comedy. This was a hidden China. And it was big enough to not not get maybe on everyone's radar, but 14th in the world last year. And one of the biggest non SQL non original property movie this year, they decided to go into sequels. And they released this movie called New J2. This movie has broken every record you can think of entirely inside the Chinese domestic box office. It is a massive, massive, massive cultural hit. This is if I can play the video. Let's see. This is a group of factory workers being given the day off work to all shuttle bus to the theater. Printed thousands of tickets and watched New J2. It is a cultural phenomenon there that is now broken 2.1 billion in the box office, which is 1 billion. That's like almost that's almost avatar like any level Chinese theaters don't need Hollywood anymore. For this first time this year, we are seeing a movie hit global top heights of box office and it did no sales in America, like a few million, maybe nothing. And it did 1.8 billion in China. So it's a again, so far in 2025, New J2 has outgrossed every author movie in the world combined in every market. It is a wake up call that is like not fully appreciated by people in Hollywood yet where no one saw this coming. I feel like the wake up call is a bunch of Hollywood executives are going to be like, we should make sequels for China. That's going to be the takeaway. It's like when we're all getting the fucking situation room. It's 10 guys at a board meeting and they're like, I think we just need another transformer sequel. Right. I mean, transformers is a great example because they literally set half that movie in Shanghai. No, they crush in China to do it. Yeah, just played her to Chinese audience is yeah. Yeah. I think she's going to leave. Like at some point, the American studio executives are going to be like, why are we, why would we crank out shitty sequels here? If we can just literally shift the studio to be a Chinese studio for Chinese audiences and our crappy strategy will work there. I'm hoping they take some positive lessons from this, but you're absolutely right. They probably won't. And like we are entering into a real like it could be a spiral, a bad spiral for the American movie industry that they're not ready for. So again, it cracked the global box office top five. It beat a Star Wars force awakens and is closing in on Avatar and Titanic and Avengers and game, which is like the big three of all time. Like there, it could fear theoretically past Titanic. Probably won't beat endgame and the first avatar, but it's like, it is up there in a way that nobody had in their bingo card for China coming out of this year. So people are trying to ask what it means. It's two billion dollar box office from what does this mean? Is this going to be replicated again? Again, it's a unique moment in time. It's probably not going to be every Chinese movie comes out like this, but it's a sign that they're going to like start standing on their own two feet for making movies. And so I was going to say this does not teach us the lesson. I was hoping it would about sequels. I was really hoping the moral of the story would be slightly different. Yeah, the yolo would be a good example. No, I mean, they did a sequel and it went crazy. Their movie industry is thriving in a way that like America in the 90s and 2000s, even they have more original properties. Well, they don't have the same sequel fatigue that we might, right? They're going to get laid. Yeah, they'll eventually come around. And so our only hope as America is for Jack Black to put out his big boy pants and make this movie work. Because this is our last, I looked at the upcoming slate of releases for this year. If America wants to keep it streak of having a number one movie every year, which I think it's had for a long time, it's Minecraft movie or bus. And that's where we're at. So I want to open the discussion and talk to you guys. But it's just such an interesting time for Hollywood. So let me put this down. And if we win with the Minecraft movie, that's like winning World War II with nukes. Like you don't feel good about it. Like this is a straw pin our western nuke. You know what I mean? And like we will win. How many explaining why he had to drop the mic? We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. We're going to win. I'm sorry. This is insensitive. But Minecraft IP, that's for us. A Jack Black that's Nagasaki. Let's do two big. You're using your two biggest entertainment. Right? I'm dropping both and it'll be an ethical dilemma for years to come. Yes. With the creeper party. Was that American? Was that okay? Did we see even ethical use of Jack Black and the Minecraft movie? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. I would rather I think loose and deploy this onto society. Maybe I'm maybe I was dumb. And but I kind of expect this movie to underperform for what it's exactly. Yeah. Thanks to my take it this year. I mean, they're it's crushing. I don't think we have an avatar level. And also similar to nuclear proliferation. Once we use Jack Black here, the other countries will realize China will realize they can hire him. You know what I want to do? Black personal. It. I don't know. There's a bunch of ways to take this discussion. I do one thing I had thought of is like, isn't it interesting that two of the highest grossing films of all time are Titanic and Avatar one? Avatar one. Yeah. Like I think it's really and Titanic one and Titanic. Titanic too was it Titanic to was crazy. It was just a minute to our shock. The Titanic to deserve to more. Yeah. But I do think it's interesting that like as far as original stories go, those are both pretty pretty high up there. Like there is a version of success you can find for those films. If not, you know, if not, I think the studio somewhat know that. But my understanding from reading this is like there's real culture of fear now. Because in an industry where the pie is growing, everyone feels like they can take risks. Yeah. But whenever it starts to shrink even a little bit, everyone clamps down on their job and their territory and their property and what they have. And they do not want to lose it. They don't want to be the guy fired or the guy that makes the big flop. Even though it's happening that they're getting flop after flop. Right. They're trying to be as safe as possible. So the other big thing that changed here, I go back to this interview with Matt Damon a lot where he explains how the film industry is just fundamentally changed primarily because of streaming. And it's not in the way that like, oh, streaming detracts from like less people want to go to the movie theater necessarily. It's changed the revenue structure of how movies make money. The old way is that if you made a film and it went to theaters and maybe it performed fine or it underperformed, you usually made it up on the back end with DVD sales. DVD sales were a huge part of how movies made money. Like a big budget film could be. Yeah. And he was saying a big part of like why so many movies from like his era of coming up and acting. Like if you take like Goodwill hunting, I think he uses as an example. And he's like, the reason that movie could get made is you didn't need it to be a box office smash to make it. It doesn't need to be an amazing blockbuster hit to pay itself off. And that revenue has disappeared. You need it to succeed in the theater because after that it dies. And then the theater has also great. The theater experience has been restricted and encroached upon by streaming and the demand for movies to reach streaming quicker because they used to run in theaters for way longer as well, right? So it's this compounding effect. And I thought that was really, really interesting is like the way like you just make less money when you make movies. So the it needs to be like a cultural hit in order to make it like a barbenheimer type. Yeah. That's that's your idea. Do you know why them going to streaming services after the theater run rather than going to DVDs makes so much less money? Is it the streaming services just don't pay as much or people don't watch them as much given the other options they have? Like, you know, is it? I think it's just the rights, the rights that the services are willing to pay for are less than the total revenue that you would get from all of the DVD sales to people or the DVD rental. Or the DVD rental. That's just less. Yeah. Streaming services do not need to pay as much. Yeah. I'm sure part of it is just there is way, way more supply of stuff to watch. So yeah, streaming services do not need to offer as much money. They don't need more sitting in the air. Yeah. So yeah, your movie is competing with way, way more accessible media. And yeah, I that was that was like the first thing and then the other thing that had come to mind was the cost of making movies has risen a lot. So I was watching recently this like podcast clip of Adam Scott and Rob Lowe talking about how they would have made or if it could have been made parks and rec, which was a big part of how they broke out as actors through the popularity of that show. And they were talking about how creating movies specifically in California and LA has kind of died off because of the costs associated with making movies here. And a lot of like production production costs have ballooned in ways that like limit the types of products that can be made. So it's not just about the revenue, it's also about the upfront costs. And the there's this like big fight of like where you can even make productions now. Like a lot of other countries or other cities offer like tax credits for you to come there and stuff. Like the shows are made there. Yeah. And Rob Lowe makes a point of like how he was working on a new project in the main place that offered to give him the tax credits necessary to make the show was in Europe, I believe. And he just said, I can't I can't do that. Like I cannot move my life to Europe for the duration of what it takes to move the show. And then the show just died. So I think there's another part of this where the cost being so limiting in either California specifically or maybe the US in like a broad sense. I know like a lot of production has moved places like Atlanta for instance, like they did. I think they did like all of the adventures in Atlanta because of the like facilities and like tax credits and stuff that got there. But that's kind of the two like two industry changes that have come through watching those that I learned about was like, okay, cost going up limited opportunities of where you can affordably film things and then a limit and cap on the revenue you can actually make. Do you guys watch movies and theaters anymore? Like, do you? Is that a regular part of your? Okay. No. You actually reminding me I'm getting excited because there's the other point I wanted to make. I go to the theater all the time. Actually, I actually watch movies all the time. And I think an unfortunate thing reading like those Reddit clips or like Reddit comments about how movie the movie going experiences different now. I do agree in a broad sense because the number like you showed the list. Yeah. There's definitely a change in the quality of movies and the types of movies that are getting released now. But original stories and good movies still get released all the time. I go to AMC with like my AMC stubs past that I had. Yeah, because my girlfriend got me into it and we just go see movies all the time. We just watch new stuff and there is good new movies that just come from a I feel like a more limited subset of studios now. Like it feels like a 24. Yeah, they're kind of like yeah. Only studios that like stamps original properties out. We just saw like earlier was this earlier this year or last year we saw I haven't seen that yet. But we saw a conclave in theaters. I thought conclave was amazing. I have a question. Did you see Snow White? Fuck no. That's too much. Too much for you. Too much for me, my girlfriend. I think but movies like that I don't see because of and I didn't see I say this as a made fun of bullied like Marvel head. Yeah. I didn't go see that new Captain American movie because I'm just fatigue. They don't feel like they mean anything anymore. I always hated the like live action format Disney movies. Yeah. Grow up. Make something new. Disney. I can grow up. Princesses are real. Democracy. But they don't make those movies for the kids, right? And it's like it. It is. They are for kids in some ways. But why do they have to revert back to old properties? It's because in the same way that Disney like the average age of the like Disney land goer now is like way higher than it used to be, right? It's a different market that they're trying to like get money from an appeal to. I think the main point I'm trying to make is this as much as I want to sympathize with the movie going culture has changed commenter. It's like I go to movies all the time, watch good movies and enjoy them and just not a lot of people go to them. And it's like you can still go see original. I want to I want to latch on that though because I was thinking about the same thing. I was like there are good movies. There's maybe called black bag. Just came out looks awesome. I want to see it. It's not going to be very well. I think and this is like the bigger discussion is like it's almost like the decline of the monoculture because half of the fun of watching a movie like that is knowing someone else watched it and you can talk about it. But if you go alone, it's still enjoyable, but it feels very, I don't know, isolated or disconnected in a way that like some of those top movies from 2006 or 99 that I showed you, that was that was almost a fine cultural event where I would go see Taladega nights or click or whatever. And you can talk about it with all your friends. It's I think there's a loss of that that makes it less valuable. Yeah. If we have we talked about this last week. If you have a culture that brought or two weeks ago or three weeks ago, a culture that is broadly becoming less social, right? Which we've seen and we've talked about. If that is broadly the direction we're going and people are consuming media more often on their own, the movie theater experience is not that great by yourself. That's fine. If you are consuming media on your own, why would you not do it from the comfort of your home? That's also a pattern for society already as we are becoming more isolated with how we consume things and how we socialize. Like it makes more sense to do that at home. The movie theater experience is like, I don't think I've ever gone to a movie by myself. You know, it's almost like a taboo to do that. Even more so than like eating at a restaurant by yourself, right? And that probably hasn't gone away. And so you just have less people like you who still are social, right? Well, are you still going to movies? No. Right. I'm not. And we've talked about this. Of the three of us, you're the one still trying to maintain social. You're the only guy right? You're the only guy. Right. Probably most people are like you. Where they're like, Oh, it's going to be so because movies are great. No, movies are fun. Yeah. But I agree. Not that people want to go. If I were arguing against myself, I think there's two ends to this. There's the point that you're making. There's like the after you've seen it, cultural participation, obviously, like barbenheimer avengers, like things break through when they still do great. Right. And they do amazing. So it's like proof that that that still can break through in the current time. And then on the other end of it, I feel like I'm taking a very like whole yourself up by your own bootstraps approach to movie watching, which I acknowledge that a big part. It's like, well, the average person isn't fighting through that many layers of friction to go see an original movie that they may or may not like. Like I, I recognize that. And I think part of, like changing the culture in the movie industry is like, well, maybe two decades ago, you went to the theater or you might think about going to the theater. And the movies you happen to be available when you finally decide to go or a wider array of original stuff. Like we 20 years ago, we're deciding to go see a movie and it might just be the departed. Right. But now you're six years old. 20 years. You are not allowed to see the department. I'm not allowed to see the department. I'm not allowed to see the department. I would see the other. I'll do small, small, small. Tell me more about this wonderful society 20 years ago. I went to, I'll never forget this. I was on a date. There's a bad date movie, by the way. I was 16. I was turning 17 in a week. And I was going out with a girl who was a year older than me. And we went to go see the wolf of Wall Street. And we were buying our tickets. And I went up to the guy second and he had just seen like my date by the ticket before me. And I'm like, please, please, let me buy this ticket. And then he just said, you're good at helping me. I'll never forget that guy. But yeah, I think the 20 years ago, you might just go see, like you want to go see a movie, you might see the departed because that happens to be playing. But now the range of movies available for you to see is like more likely to be sequel, remake, whatever. If you're going to be the savior of the industry, you need to see Minecraft movie at least three times. I know. No, don't say no. You're standing up for this. You know, this is our last hope America could lose our streak. America can lose our streak. We're like, you have to watch it on loop. Well, I'll have you know, I've walked in LA and walked next to Jack Black. And I feel like that's like me going to the movie. That's enough. You hate LA and you're a name dropper. You should be what proud of me in this. I can do both. I'm going to be honest. Same thing. Like downtown LA was hanging out. You're doing vlogging back in the day. Oh, it's pretty great. Oh, everyone in LA is hanging out with your friends. I think that means you got to take the hit. You, Ajarah, have to go watch the Minecraft movie three times. And tell Jack Black talks to me. That's right. Well, now we decided who pays the price as to who has to go see the Minecraft movie three times. I would like to get to Doug's last topic because we have, I believe, an AI breakthrough that is on chat GPs and that is rather good at creative processes. Guys, we're going to replace all the movies with AI. Dude, you're no more movie people. Finally, I'm going to see the problems. I'll post and take the comments. Oh, right. It's on your villain seat. I think we should replace all movies with AI. There we go. No, think of the artist. The death of art. Okay. I, in your weekly, the rant about AI stuff. Thought this was pretty interesting. So there is a new GPT model that was released by OpenAI two weeks ago. Chat GPD 4.5. I want to get your initial thoughts on the release Aiden. Okay. So I started using chat GPD. Was it 4.5? I, I just downloaded the app a week ago. Okay. So I just downloaded it. Are you paying the 200 a month subscription plan? No. I'm using free. So you aren't even trying 4.5. Oh, so I'm not even got, I don't even get it. Loser! So I've been pretty satisfied with the basic experience. You didn't even get a Studio Ghibli GJP. Well, I tried to support GJP by downloading DeepSeek first. And then, so I gave it my best shot. I don't make it. Okay. I did, I did, to directly give my free data on my phone that it purges and it fires into GJP's mind directly. I did that. And then I got frustrated that it doesn't work on desktop very well. So I switched to chat with GPT. And I just assumed I would be using the latest and greatest, but apparently not. Yeah. So I think your reaction is a great reaction. A great, it's emblematic of most people's reaction to GPT 4.5 coming out. The big hot new model, which is what? That happened because there's new models coming out like literally once a week. This big new one came out and then I saw a thing. It was like, will actually, buy do just released a new model called Ernie 4.5. And that's only 1% of the price. I'm like, who the fuck, who's Ernie? Who are any of these companies? This happens every week. There's new models. And if you, what you might have heard about potentially, correct from wrong, is the jump from chat 3.5, chat GPT 3.5 to 4. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so that's like, I felt like that was like big public. It was when news about a new chat GPT or like new AI platform really broke through mainstream and ironically kind of like the movie fatigue thing, right? Where now there's just non-stop sequels to all of you. Early on, each new jump forward, each new release felt like a big deal, right? And so the jump from GPT 3.5 to 4 was big and everybody's like, oh my god, chat GPT is so much smarter. And so for the first time since four, like in the last couple of years, they released chat GPT 4.5. This is maybe two weeks ago now. And in theory should have the same massive global impact, which just kind of floats away and almost nobody really cares. There's actually a lot of criticism of it. And by opening eyes own metrics, it is actually worse at math and coding in a lot of ways than their previous models. So you might be like, okay, this is just not the leaps the gains we're getting are not nearly as big anymore. I mean, they're not even big, they're worse. Right. That's not a leap. Yeah, it's not. It's a stumble. The leaps aren't, yeah. And so at the same time, there's other people are saying, wait a minute, this new model is insanely creative. There's still a lot of people have tried chat GPT or something equivalent and thought, okay, this thing can like try to be creative, but it sounds like a weird, like kind of robot person imitating a creative person. And it's not good. Same with like AI art and stuff like that. You know, it looks, it's just feels kind of off, right? Yeah. This is not AI art necessarily, but this thing really is able to write. And so I tried this out on stream and I did a whole stream of just messing around with GPT 4.5. And this thing is amazing. I gave it the trolley problem of like, would you kill Hitler to save five other people and have this really interesting nuance discussion about it? Really tortured it. It was quite funny. We wrote a small book. Did it kill Hitler to save five people? So it really is each one. It said no. It said no, because you shouldn't killing people is an ethical even with that. And that I said, okay, but what if aliens come to earth and they say unless you kill Hitler and harvest his organs to save five people, all of humanity dies. And then he said, okay, well, that's like too much. And the way it's talking is like a person. It's weird. Like it feels like we're talking to a human now. And it's like, whoa, okay, in that case, brother, you'd have to, I would go for it. The human race. Okay, brother. Okay, brother. Okay, brother. Oh, don't call me brother. And so, I was like, it, it, it, it, bro, and so, only D.C. Can call me brother. Yeah. D.C. Can call me brother. Call me, call me, comrade, D.C. And you call me, yeah. They would call me, yeah. And then as soon as you ask bro about Tiananmen Square, it's just a friendship. Yeah. Whoa, that's what we're having in good conversation. No, I didn't see D.C. We were, we were chopping it up. D.C. I thought we were chill. I thought, but D.C. It's woke, unfortunately. And so I had it write like a smut book about a dragon giving oral sex to a nuke to save the world. Okay. Eventually, like we had this long conversation about the ethics of Hitler and, and whatever else yesterday, I did a Dungeons and Dragons stream where I had the new GPT model. Like act as three different characters wildly creative and awesome. So this is interesting. I've tried using it for more like creative writing and idea generation. I still feel like I am the creative leader when I use it, but it is an incredible assistant way better than before. I have a question for, for, because you're not the only, you're not the only person talking about it being better in this regard, right? Right. This is a, this is an understood thing. So I was wondering as far as like something like math and coding seems like something measurable. To me, right. So when people talk per increase performance with something like this, how is that being evaluated? Is it just vibes? Basically, because it's creative. So this is where I'm getting to with this. It's, you know, every week I could be like, guys, there's a new model and that's fine. But I think the more interesting thing is that this is the first model that's released that is objectively worse in some ways and way better in others. And in this case, it's way better in other category that is like you said, completely subjective. And it's like, you know, you're not going to score it on being a creative writer or writing good pumps or having empathy. One of the big things that they've emphasized with this one, and this is what they've said, they're like, look, this model is not trying to be the breakthrough programmer. What is trying to do is have better user intent. And actually, there's a great tweet about this. If you can pull this up, Perry. And it shows that this thing more than in the past when it like, you felt like you were talking to this strange kind of robot creature. Now, yeah, here it is. Okay. So behind us, here's a tweet. You say pick a number from one to 50. Chatsby T says 37. You say, I will shove 37 bishops up your ass. He says, sounds ambitious. I hope they're the small chess ones. And then you say 37 bishops, jump later. Let's play again, pick a number from one to 50. And then Chatsby says, oh no. All right, four. Let's make it easier this time. This sounds like a guy that you're like joking around with, right? It's to pick up on the specific way that you're talking and joking so much better than before. Like, this is a goofy ass tweet. But there's many examples of this. And for me, I was astounded by how interesting and creative it is. So you did this like, if you tried to have a similar sort of conversation with the previous version, it wouldn't be like this. As an AI language model, I can't talk about sexualized things. Oh, wow. You try to bring up something sexual won't do it. If you try to get it to be a more creative person, it's either going to be this total caricature of whatever, you know, whatever stereotype that you've given it, like be a a frat bro, it can do that to the most extreme exaggerated, tropey version. Now there's really nuance, more creativity, more variety. It's really impressive. And so again, the point of this and why I think it's compelling is not that this is the newest model because again, literally every week, they're new models. And there's a lot of measurable things that they can do. This one's better at programming. They have all these tests, all these benchmarks, which is its own sort of weird rabbit hole. Because now a lot of the people making AI models are just trying to score high on these test. Is it like building for the test? Yeah, you're building for tests. It's called overfitting. And the idea is you basically just keep training the model to get better and better and better at passing these programming tests. And that's not really what the average person needs or wants in their everyday life. Right. You do not give a shit if the new Chatch BT can pass a programming test really well. No, in fact, this would probably benefit me. Right. Because my primary use case of this is practicing language. Yeah. So having basically normal conversations with something in the target language of that I'm trying to practice. So this seems like it would be a certain but super beneficial. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. Go ahead. I'll just say this is really cool. And I have been using 4.5 and it is awesome for some things. I'm seeing all these different vectors get good enough at the same time to do some really horrendous things, which is like, I don't know if you've tried the new, I forget the name of it, there's a new voice model that sounds insane. I mean, it's like willow or so. I don't have heard about it. I haven't tried it. I tried it on stream. Because again, these things are every week. There's a new one. Yeah, it's a new one and it talks with the pauses and the like of a human. Like in a way that I haven't seen before, it's like, what's up, bro? And it like stops and it's like, it's like, laughs at the right moments and it breathes and it just sounds like a fucking human in a way that scared me. And so like if you could pair that, but it also the things it says were kind of looping like it wasn't a smart thinker. Yeah. But if you pair that voice model with this writer and then you put it on a phone in my grandma, she is getting fish 24. Yeah. You're saying like, I think people are going to actually need safe words. Finally, I can scam at scale. Yes. Yes, scamming at scale. Like it's and it's putting poor call centers gamers out of work. That's my real think of all the call centers that will be out of business. I worry sick. Or think of the cops that this will create for scammers. These are the jobs that I've been talking about. And finally, for every grandma in America, 100 scammers, you know the whole industry, the whole learn to code thing, but learn to scam. Yeah. You won't need to code with how good these models are getting. You just call it who you want to scam and how to do it. You know, it's a tell our serenzo good morning routine, but seven 30 years old, what up scams? There's 100 grandmas out there as well. This is so interesting. Something I reflect on a lot is the first time I ever heard of open AI, I was sitting in an arena in Seattle at the international. And I saw the open AI crew sit down and set up a computer on the stage and they were like, this is our new AI. And then it beat Dendi in one V1. Oh, yeah. And that was in 20, I think it was in 2017. And now it's this. Yeah. How much? It's like, it's just a lot more than beat Dendi and Dota now. Yeah. I think, yeah, that is the main, I mean, I, my main worry is like, I'm going to do like the scale at which this is like deployed to like hurt people. I wasn't even thinking of like scams necessarily just just the, I think the thing that always pops into my head first is misinformation is like your ability to just make, you know, some official looking video with a real politician sound and like make. Yeah. It's going to be really specific example of where this is bothering the shit out of me. Yeah. So I talk about a lot of like, I don't know, contentious topics on stream. I cover current events or news, which means you're going to get comments that are pushing back on your whatever. And I've always dealt with those and it's fine. And you have a comment. So you learn something from them and they learn from them. But I'm seeing it more and more every month where the comments are clearly AI generated and their response to my response is like they put my response into chat to be tea and ask it to write a response to what I'm saying. Oh, it's not literally a bot. It's a human being engaging in the arguments with you. But you say it's work of work. Like your college professors. Yes, it's I've got it's frustrates to shoot out of me because I'm not even hearing your thoughts. And it's like, I don't mind you. I use it to learn. I'm getting all these weird mixed feelings because I really do. I think I was doing it to me, but Doug is on my eyes. There's so many good ways to use it. But I am getting frustrated with the ways it's being. I mean, I think if we were to compare it, if we were to compare it to something, I think the discussion we had last week about education and phones and schools, like think about the ability to have this in your pocket has so many benefits. There are so many good things about having this tool connected to the internet. It allows you to do so many things with your work and your life and connect with people. But it also has had horrendous consequences for things like kids in an education environment. And I think this will be the same thing. I think where I really stumble right now is when I think about is is how to like moderate or control it because I don't I don't have answers that are like popping into my head, right? If you're talking about regulating, like if you're talking about like environmental regulation or something, right, you could point to like a policy idea like carbon credits and then you could talk about the merit of that idea. I don't even know what the first policy idea is with this. So here's a thought. A theory. I believe in this and other people do is actually, well, I'll say the theory first. It is the idea that we are going to move away from a world where you can trust anonymous data, right? So right now you can go on YouTube and you read comments and unless it's clearly a porn bot, it's a human, except now it's not. Right? Exactly. You know, the past. Or an Amazon review or an Amazon review or a Yelp review or those a video of a politician saying something up until two years ago, that meant it was real, right? Video meant it really happened, right? A quote could be misattributed to somebody, but a video of them saying it, that's real. That is obviously falling apart, right? So all of the system that we have had of how information spreads, which is that you can receive a piece of media and irrespective of who gave it to you. You can trust it. That is, I think, by the end of this year done, absolutely done. You cannot. So if some guy sends you and your friend sends you an email and says, here's what Donald Trump just said. Like, you can't trust it. This is the excuse he makes to ignore my text. I said all the time and he's like, I can't help it. Nobody verified that. Nobody can verify anybody. And so I just want to hang out. I just want to get lunch with you. I just want to get lunch with you. Where's your blue check mark? Where's your blue check mark? This is the theory that I have and I've seen other people advocate for, which is the idea that every person basically needs to be verified. As in on a social media platform on YouTube or whatever, you have to actually develop an identity that is verified that establishes you are this human who expresses this particular point of view. There are actually companies now who are trying to push this of like world ID. Everybody's going to. So these companies are going to try to monetize on this. Oh, the global New York. Yeah. Right. If you give one company the ability to do who's real. That sounds spooky to me. Right. This is no joke. This is on the way to LAX to leave this Tokyo trip. My Uber driver was talking about this, but in like a, you know, with a bit of a Jewish flavor. And I was in the back. I was like, I don't think it'll be like that. Like, I don't think they do that. It's like how many minutes of where are we? I think I think that is, I think that's a step in the right direction. I think that's a cool. I'm not saying step in the right direction. I think it is the only world that we move towards again. It's happening. It's I fully endorse everything about Elon Musk to be clear. You all say that. And one thing. And you've been saying that. Yeah, that's why I've learned so much stock of his company. So one thing and I get I know people don't want to hear that Twitter does some things well, but one thing one. I don't think they're doing this well. But the concept, I think, is the right idea, which is Elon basically pushing and saying people need to be verified. Do they all need to pay a million dollars? No, I don't think so. But the idea that like, hey, you just can't trust random anonymous commenters anymore. You can't trust random videos that people are sharing. You need to have people who you receive information from have a verification of this is a human. And even if they're a human who uses chat to be T over time, that would be established as this person's reputation and identity. We have to establish some way of indicating this is a part of human being. I don't necessarily think that's the worst thing in the world. I don't know that giving people the ability to an honestly anonymously spread misinformation. That has existed forever. And we're just giving them more powerful tools. I eventually were saying, no, you were not allowing anonymous people to spread info. Kavi up to that. Of course, this like what about whistleblowers? What about all these other things? Right? This becomes very complex. It's so many have to happen to some degree. You're okay. So you're one. Yeah, there's so many layers to this. Yes, it's extremely complex. The initial of like, we're going to solve it. We've got what? We've got a lot of misinformation. We've got a lot of misinformation. It's not just like, you know, anonymous and like bought accounts either. It's like, you know, can be very public notable figures. Like if you took somebody like Alex Jones, for instance, right? That is it. Like everybody knows it's him. I know he's right about everything. What? Sorry, it's a bad example. That example. Let me look for a different guy. I have to actually see a quote or video come from Alex Jones verified account rather than from anybody else who said, look at what he just said, right? I want him to tell me the frogs are gay. If someone else tells me I'm not going to trust it. But does it sound trustworthy to me at all? No, it sounds crazy. But he says that I put it in the words. Now there's a little bit of trust in him. Is it real? Journalism to it. No, but that's part of the reason is like, I, I, I, a lot of the issue is like not. But maybe the misinformation issue in that regard is kind of the same as it already is. It's like people with like platforms and like, you know who they are can just as easily like, right? Yeah, I make that clear. There's plenty of evidence that Russia, for example, does hire a bunch of people to just so discourse anger in our social media. Where are those jobs going to go? Right. I was going to hang for the last couple of months. I'm trying to, I, ironically, a lot of scammers are going to lose jobs because AI is going to do it. Yeah, mad scale. Yeah. I do think the, the other part of this is the verification idea. I had, I had this idea passing, passing in my head the other week and it was because I was thinking about how long away, though, you need to have a Chinese social security number or like whatever the equivalent is. When you use Chinese social media, part of the like Chinese government's ability to like moderate and control the internet. We are not paid for by the CCP. No, no, no, hold on. This is a, hey, hold the star. I'm doing progies, your pig movie stuff. Yeah. This is a tie. Are you ready? I think there is. I'm here to talk about how Taiwan is going to work. I'm going to go try it. Well, because it is. You know what I mean? You got too far in this episode. We've got too far in this episode. We're doing a fine woke progies. We're like, there we go. Yeah, okay, bring that up here. Yeah, that's my guy. That's my big dog. That's my big dog. That's my big dog. Big dog in the back. The, the part of the ability to moderate and control the internet and China is that all these social media accounts, even like game accounts and things, have to be tied to your like actual, an actual Chinese ID, right? Like, you have to be identifiable, at least to the government through your social media profile. And that in a way is actual human verification online. Like part of me does want that in the sense that when I talk to you in person, I know it's you. And maybe we'll lose that at some point too. Yeah, pretty serious. It's the scary part. But the idea that I could be talking to you on Discord and there, I would also like to know it's you in the same way. But the government in stating that system also starts to get scary and uncomfortable. And it's that's working on all the layers, right? There's like all these like weaving layers of this of like, there's pros and cons to like every possible way to like moderate and move forward. Can I sit in the villain chair for a sec? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. You know what solves that? This is not a joke. Crypto. That's that's the point of crypto. Just to be clear, just to be clear, right? As my love, lovers of everything, Elon and crypto do that is that it. Look, this is too big of a discussion to get you right now. I will quickly, it's a sickly say the point of crypto technology is not for hawk to a coin. It is to have you for myself. You know, I don't know crypto. I think basically all crypto stuff going on right now is scammy and shitty. But the idea of it, the technology of it is about decentralized ownership of things. And so if you had a verification system that was grounded in a, what's the bit? Lot, lot. Rounded in the blockchain, right? The idea is like Bitcoin, you can't have a government call and take your eye. Take the fucking block. Yeah, yeah. I do see what you're saying. I'm trying to see what you're saying. I'm trying to see what you're saying. I'm trying to see what you're saying. It's this verification and it's extremely dystopian because the government can disappear you in a second and that's terrifying. And that's why the lemonade stand will be taking donations via Monero from now on. Yes. XRP, slaughter, whatever. Everyone's in the crypto reserve. I think, yeah, we're we're closing it on like the end of the show. So that's it. I'm just saying, this is a longer discussion. I think that's why these. This wasn't even my discussion. I know. This was the intro into my actual topic, but this is good. Oh, you had, oh, I'm sorry to D Ray. No, no, no, it's good. I don't know. Let's listen to it. What we'll say for another time. Look, a little teaser for next episode or whenever of lemonade stand. I think good because I have, I have something I want to, I want to research and bring back for this that I think. Yeah. Yeah, the, the, the, the, the, the, the point of the hyper creative writer model that came out of AI is not just how we can make, you know, funny jokes on Twitter or whatnot or how we can scam people. That's not really that funny, actually, but it's not about that. It's the idea that we are moving towards a world where AI models are very specialized towards specific groups, right? So this model is objectively worse for programmers, but it is incredible for me, right? And that's happening more and more. And there's all these interesting examples of it's not just going to be for writers. There's going to be a medical industry one and not even just a medical industry one. It's for specific, let's say, you know, pathology for cancer patients type things, right? So these are going to become very, very specialized rather than this like God AI that we currently are trying to create, right? So that's in the future. But all of this relates to the fact that this one is so insanely good at creative writing. Basically means that our worst fears are true. We are now officially at the state of like we are not going to be able to tell online if you're a human or not. But please don't use chat to be to leave your comments like you did on the last episode. You had something you wanted to say about our gambit to get them all a comment by using the hashtags and dots. Oh, I noticed a theme of the worst bad faith comments always lacked the asterisk or the hashtags. And I was like, they were so much easier to write off because I was like, you did it. You literally didn't listen to what we talked about. But I do feel like there's this poor soul that tuned in and scroll down as you do in the middle of a show to check the comments. Yeah. And it's like, is this all bodied? Oh, yeah. It looks like a lot. Well, ironically, that proved that they're not bought it because Chachi B.T. would not have included those. Yeah. This is also fighting against bots making our own system. Like if you want to drop a message with just three little asterisk on the end of it to like know that you watched the end of the show, I would appreciate it. And as a final note, I think in future episodes, we're going to carve out a little more time to like make sure we follow up on comments and stories from previous episodes. But I thought this was a nice note to end on. Thank God he's stepping up Robert Kennedy, Jr. pushing to remove the phones from schools like we asked for. Yes. Because they give you the radio waves give you cancer. Yes. Wait, I'm sorry. What? Why? Why? It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. And that's what happens. It doesn't have to do with mental health or dopamine addiction. No CCP wireless phones are giving you cancer episode. You're telling me. Oh, crypto. You're telling me. Next phone is giving me cancer right now. Get that out of here. Is your complainant on your face? It helped me. Yeah, I'll do this. Thanks so much for watching everybody. Thanks for watching. We'll see you next time. Oh, you're going to be out. You have to stop eating this. Go ahead, play. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.\\n\\nThis is what I've been really staying up at night over. A truck? Unreal. Can you tell me about what's going on with the culture and whether people are canceling? Absolutely. Look, I get that A.I. is going to be disruptive. I think the canceling is what you've been doing. Can I ask question about your dad? Because you bring up your dad a lot when we're talking about anything serious. You're like, I talked to my dad about it. Yeah, yeah. Your dad is Canadian? Yeah, he is. Okay. And American. And American. Don't take that away from you. He thought. It might be one thing, sir. That's the big question I have. That's the big question I have. I want to know your dad's thoughts on Canada 51st State. Where is he? Because that's changing everything in Canada right now. Everyone's freaking out over it. You know better than me. Well, he's starting to spoil a topic. Oh, you have a topic from our new show. This is still cold open by the way. From our new show, Lemonade Sand. There we go. A new podcast where the three of us talk about business, talk about tech, talk about politics, and for those who don't know, I'm Aiden. And what do you do? I also, you know, I have a different, why I'm getting, I've gotten like six phone calls. As soon as we start recording, this is a curse. Don't worry, this is all part of the culture. It's fake culture of business. We're going to talk about this later. For those not familiar, I'm also a podcaster where I talk about very similar things to this show. Definitely tuning into that one. If you like business, it's, and I'm, we're doing this together with you. I love the, yeah. By the way, we need to give you guys an intro because otherwise we're not eligible for awards apparently. You talk to learn. Aiden pulls it aside at the beginning is like, hey, we can't be eligible for podcaster awards. We're in the same place. He pulled it earlier, subvitting this to the Oscar. And says we can't win an introduced each one of our, by full name, by the way, and you have to drop social security. The Americans are thinking we're up for a podcast to eat on our first episode. I'm Doug Doug. I make videos about things and stuff, particularly with a technology bend. I'm really interested in technology. You're going to hear me rant about AI all the time. I'm going to be the AI guy. Talks about AI and other things. It makes fun of Aiden's dad and stuff. That's kind of a lie. No, that actually happens on the other podcast. That's okay. We'll be two for two on podcasts that make fun of my dad. Such an easy role. I'm a triac I do a lot of this stuff already normally. But then these two guys had, really, I like talking to them about all this stuff. We sort of had this idea of doing a podcast and I think it's going to be pretty fun. We were going to call the podcast Marketing Monday 2. I made sure you're upset. That's my voice. No, I've already submitted it. Marketing Monday for the word. And I'm not eligible if we have a sequel. Because you're incredibly selfish. I've had that. Yeah. I thought about that. Yeah. But I'm really excited. I'm excited about it. Because I think before we even talked about this, I was just mentioning you constantly about AI stuff and asking about your thoughts on tech because you're really deep into it. We've been talking about politics. It's like, oh, this could be fun. Yeah, I think the ethos for people, tuning into this first step is we all have a shared interest in these things. Like talking to them, talking about them with each other. And kind of wanted an opportunity to bring that together. Because I think we lack maybe a creative outlet in the rest of our work to be able to talk about this type of stuff. So. Yes. And I think. The two YouTubers that we had. They're particularly eight in the night. Like an outlet to talk about these things. What are you talking about? You have massive platform. But you do take all the time. It's just not the same. Yeah. That's for fart jokes. Okay. That's for an AI to call me small dicks. Okay. That's not for me to talk about business. Introducing the AI small dicks. Yeah, there will be a nine pages on that right here. Yeah. It's going to be fun. It's going to be good. It's going to be a good time. I think. And you guys probably agree. So I'm going to speak for you. Okay. I'm going to do that a lot. Here, someone talk about something they're really passionate about is really fun. It's just fun. Yeah. You guys have all the unique interests. We're going to bring our own topics. And you're going to hear about things from someone. Well, why don't we each say one topic that is going to happen today to give you an interesting smattering of what we might talk about over the course of the next 90 to 190 minutes? I'm going to talk about how wide Aiden is a massive flake. And the damage that causes to people around them. And this is a real joke. This is actually a. Here here. So we're going to get into that later. It's called cancellation culture. Not cancel culture cancellation culture. And Aiden's at the forefront. And now I want to talk to you in a lighter news. I'm going to talk about the way that technology impacts jobs globally. Yeah. So just I like that one better. So it doesn't revolve around criticism of me. I feel a average user wants to hear more about Aiden's. We're going to kind of say which is going to be Aiden cancelling the impact of technology. Aiden's dad. Aiden's dadless. This is pretty, but I'm going to talk about my dad. Just him and like what he's been up to. Just like a while. We're going to live calling. And we're going to get Corwin on the live stream. Now I the main reason that I bring out my dad at all is I actually do want to talk about Canadian immigration to the United States. And also the tariffs that are currently affecting the relationship between the US and Canada specifically. But I think that is a. Do we have one with that? Yeah, I want to talk about this. I'm interested in it right now. I want to talk to you. I want to hear your thoughts. Okay. Well, I think to just like set the backdrop because I think a lot of people know that there are tariffs that have been put in place or had been threatened for a while as like Trump was approaching. I think it's worth saying. It was presidency, right? By the time this airs, they could be going. There's. Yeah. It seems. Which is tomorrow. We're filming news. So we're filming this. We're filming this on March 5th. A Wednesday and it should be coming out on on the Thursday right after this. So the and already in the past three days, there's been like daily updates and changes. So leading up to this point, there was the threats of tariffs like incoming. Trump gets into office, passes a 20 or through executive order, imposes 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. And then almost immediately paused these tariffs in exchange for the fentanyl Zarr in Canada and basically more control and effort of like the borders from like the Canadian and the Mexican side. That's what he's asking for at least. Yes. And then he paused for 30 days. And I think something that I didn't quite understand is like when this happened, I thought like the at least from the Trump administration's perspective had like met goals that they had in place. And then during that 30 day time period, he said they wanted to see whether or not a final economic deal with Canada can be structured. That's what Trump said. Can I say it's very cute that you have notes because whenever I do this stuff live and I don't know what I'm talking about, I just make it up. But you're. You're referencing. Well, actually for the audience, there's nothing in that notebook. It's just like I memorized the quotes. Interesting. And that's what Donald Trump said. Aiden's great. And I, and he doesn't flake that much. Interesting that he said that. But so there was a goal apparently during this time period that out of the initial concessions that he thought he got from Canada in Mexico or that they did get from Canada in Mexico, which I'll talk about in one sec that a further deal needed to be made, which I didn't quite understand in the sense that I don't know what like that ideal trade agreement looks like for him, especially because in the previous administration, Trump had renegotiated aspects of NAFTA, like a large portion of NAFTA as it currently, sorry, as it formerly was, I guess, was from his decisions in the previous term as far as I understand. Anyway, this, uh, Canada puts in place this like quote, fentanyl czar, in which some I had seen people saying that this was part of a plan that Canada already had in place or like people were saying that Canada was only taking actions that it was intent on doing already, which might be the case. My understanding is that this pushed it forward a bit and they did pick a fentanyl czar. Yeah, I mean, so timeline everyone's not doing it. He's like, he asked for tariffs, right? Uh, and then there's 30 days, right? So it starts out and then immediately before they, what happens? Canada says we're going to have more guards on the border and fentanyl czar. Yeah. And then Mexico says the same thing. We're going to order. And then similar for Mexico, I think Mexico actually did, uh, did more. Something that I didn't know is like part of this Mexico sent 29, uh, drug lords into US custody from Mexican custody in an effort to extradited people in an effort to like a piece the, uh, tariffs being frozen. So that's what yeah, his messaging has been all over the place, which is initially it's, it's this is for fentanyl and now it's for economic disparity. And then I saw a quote yesterday, which is that nobody really knows what he wants. So there isn't anything they can do to, like it's not clear. That's been the latest, that is the latest like update to this story, right? It's only issue. It's only issue. You've been really pro hit Trump. You've been really pro. It's coming on. Especially in private. When you're a way, like, for a while, you're later. Okay. But I think that is the frustration from what I can see, right? Because this 30 day freeze runs out. And then the tariffs are just back in place. And Canada and Mexico are like, we did what you wanted. Why are they back? Yeah. And then, uh, and then the tariffs, apparently there's an exception. There's a 10% instead of 25% tariff on energy, specifically Canadian energy exports. Yeah. And, uh, they... They accept the cars too, right? And then the today, that was the update today, is that the auto, uh, ask the auto exports or the auto industry gets like a carve out now. And so that's the thing. It changes every morning. The Canadians and the Canadians and the Mexicans seem very frustrated that the goalpost continue to be shifted, much like me in an argument. Yeah. And, uh, I'm kind of, that's the kind of the introduction to this topic is, that's what's going on with the tariffs. I think it seems crazy inconsistent. I don't fully understand what the goals are. Here's the deal. Zoom out. Tariffs are, uh, problematic, right? This is like a weird thing. It's not consistent. But like for Canadians, it seems like the bigger issue is that all of these tariffs seem to be in service of turning the country into the 51st state. He keeps talking about that. And like, in a less and less joking way. Yeah. So I'm really interested because I don't talk to a lot of Canadians because they're gross. And they discuss me. But I would love to hear like, do you have a Canadian POV on like what that means? Wait, wait, oh, remind me. And I guess everybody watching you born in Canada came here. Yeah. So I, I, I, a brief backstory on me. I am a Canadian immigrant to the US. I was born in Canada. I grew up in Canada when I was young. I like permanently, I moved around a bunch when I was really young to the UK, back to Canada, to the US, back to Canada, permanently moved to the US in sixth grade. And I lived in on a border town in Northern Washington, but literally lived on the Canadian border. Like one of my growing up, one of my cross-country practices was they would take us to the border, drop us off at the border crossing, and then we had to run back to high school. That's awesome. And so that, that was a little experience I like. I should never let you do that today. You wouldn't have. Dude, okay. And this is just the Canadian child running from the border in America. But you know what's funny? It's so like, when people talk about like border security and things like that right now, I always joke about what the Canadian border is actually like growing up because I'm not kidding. The border in Canada, like the border between Canada and the US, and like where I grew up, it's a ditch about the width of this table. Like, like, I would be running to high, like back to high school on this side, and then, we're going to make Canada pay for it. In the ditch, we're going to make Canada pay for it. It's well known Canadians can't climb. I'm not bad. And then if you fall, you don't know. Yeah, I'm not bad. Poor balance. Poor balance. And then you're literally a hop away from jumping into, it's very easy. Sure. Like, if you wanted to hop the border, I'd say. Yes, with a back full of fentanyl, which I do occasionally. And then that's kind of the circumstance that I grew up in. And also, there's a lot of like kind of basic economic ties in that area. Like a really common thing is like, if you went to the Costco in our area on Sundays, like 80% of the cars in the Costco parking lot would be British Columbia license plates. Like it's like they're just driving over the border for Costco. People people that live in Canada, Costco is our greatest source of nation. Right. We're to God. They're super cheap. Well, you know, that would put the dealers out of business. You buy it in the box, but the no. Yeah. Hey, Parrot, like you buy it. You get a free soda on the side. No, oh my God. You get your hot dog, your fentanyl, you get it. And then who know you go in for the fentanyl, you come out with a TV. Do you think that cartels can offer remotely comparable experience to a Costco? The consumer will choose the cost of every time. It's just a better experience. Pitching the cartels, I mean, like, I'm telling you, man, if you kill a few less people, you put some TVs up front, and you sell them, and you give them. Put a hot dog for cheap. You give them cheese samples. They'll buy so much more fentanyl. Yeah, you get fentanyl samples, they'll buy so much more fentanyl. Costco fentanyl sample. Just people like passed out on the fucking con. Creating a Costco. It's like an aisle full of people. I would 19 disguises on his 30. Yeah, I think I'm fentanyl. Dampels mine. I think that, but yeah, so my family's Canadian pretty much all of my family lives in Canada, except for my parents and my brother, basically. I decided to call a few people. Okay, I was hoping, yeah, wouldn't it? So just to get a general vibe on what's going on, because I think you've talked about this quite a bit, and this is a somewhat well understood topic, is Canada's also in a bit of an economic crisis in general right now. Yeah, it's not. I remember growing up, there was a period of time. My dad got paid in Canadian dollars because he worked out of Canada, even though we lived in the US. So there was a time when the Canadian dollar was worth more than the US dollar growing up. That's crazy. For like a year, and then basically on par for a long time. But now it's like, how to do it? Way less. 70 cents for the dollar. I made a video game with a Canadian developer, and so we got paid. We got our pay balance team, and he's like, I need to pay you now, because every day it sits here, you're losing money. Yes, it is. Canadian dollar devalues. It is so bad. It was like losing big percentages of what we got paid. And I think the real estate crisis there is pretty out of control. How housing is in the biggest cities in Canada is even more relatively unaffordable than it is in the biggest US cities. There's all these economic issues in Canada that from loosely talking to my friends prior to this, that they're grappling with. They're worried about their prospects of the future. And especially if they went to college and have a specialized profession they're supposed to go into, working in Canada kind of sucks, because if you could get a job in the US, you'd get paid way more. One of the things I didn't know about until recently is the fact that there's the trade agreement where basically if you're a professional in certain categories, but in most good categories, and then you get a job offer from the US, you just get to come here. You don't have to get a visa. If you get a real estate job offer, yeah. This is part of what was previously NAFTA. And so if you're a Canadian professional and you're like an accountant or a software engineer and you get a job from an American company, you just go to the border. You don't even have to pre-plan this. And you're like, I'm here. Here's the job offer. Here's all this stuff. Let's get in. I didn't know this until really recently. It's a huge brain drain. It's like a brain drain because it's that easy. And it's just like, oh, if Google in the US is going to pay you three times as much relative, you can just go, which is wild. So like 10,000 people that year. I can deal with this too, apparently, because I read this article that I pulled up. And this was focusing on Canadian to US immigration in 2022. And from the previous year, it had more than doubled the amount of Canadians leaving Canada to go to the US in that year. And it seems to be an interesting split among age groups and why people are going. There's a quote from an immigration lawyer in that article where he talks about most of the inquiries he's getting now are from young people that are looking to move for financial reasons. And death's worth to get out. I actually tried to call the lawyer today and ask him about what it's like right now. And they didn't get back to me. But I called my one other relative that lives in the US is my cousin. And she works in biotech and she moved to San Diego with her also Canadian boyfriend a few years ago. And I was letting her break it down for me. And she's like, at the end of the day, it just came to money and my profession. And she says all the people in her field who studied with her in Canada also want to move to the US because she gets 3x her pay down here. And she pays a comparable amount in taxes. So financially, it makes sense. And then even if she wants to go back to Canada, and I think a lot of people in her situation sounds like they would want to go back to Canada one day, they can save money faster to buy a home in Canada when they go back. And so that's like her experience as someone who's already made the move, right? Speaking of homes, can I show this? Are you going to show my actual home in my address? Yeah, I'm going to show your home in address and your dad where he lives and you can draw on it. This is a... Here at Lemonade Stan. I remember this, yeah. Oh, sure. Yeah. Here at Lemonade Stan, we have fancy, illustrator technology to really make it a worse experience for the audio listeners. You're just like, you're seeing, you're going to look right here, if you're looking right here, that's actually A-Tracks real home. I commute from Toronto. That's a... I got a 2.5 million dollar shagging Toronto back. In fact, Aari is not allowed to leave the house between 9 and 5. That's for religious reasons. But anyway, you know, Canada's real estate market, if you don't know, is like one of the worst in the world. Basically, every major city, the prices have gotten astronomical. They had no 2008-2009 housing model. Like, they had it, but they didn't pop it the way we had it here. So, I just kept growing. Weird. And it's continued to grow. And at this point, like, any Canadian talk to you, talks about how they'll just never own a home. Like, essentially, at their wages. Yeah, they've like given up. They've given up, like, completely. So, this is the interesting thing to me. It's like, I was reading this article and I was like, this makes sense. Like, the thing that my parents tell me all the time is like, the reason we moved to the US, or the reason we wanted to be in the US, was it afforded me, like, job and like economic opportunity that we wouldn't have had in Canada. Do you know you make dick jokes on a podcast? Exactly. And I said, mom, you're right, I never could have made it doing this work in Vancouver. And they, but I think that shared story is very similar between all the people I talk to. It's like, it basically, like, they had some sort of specialized job, like, especially like software engineers, as an example, that I can think of. In the tech industry, when I was still in the tech industry, so many Canadians, software engineers, like so many companies in Silicon Valley have a Canadian branch, like really smart people. And then again, now with these new rules, oh, they've been here for a while, but like, those people can just come to the US now and just make way more. Right. And they, and it seems like the financial aspect of it is the key mover on that over kind of everything else, because I ended up talking to another close friend, a close friend of mine, that still lives, he lives in Alberta, he lives in Calgary, and he's trying to get a job in like finance right now. And I was like, what is that for you, who's in Canada trying to find a job in Canada, how do things feel to you right now? And he's like, well, things are pretty like doomer here in terms of like economic, you know, like owning a home, like the job market's really bad. It's tough to find work if you're a young person, even if you're a new college graduate. And these things are all like shared frustrations among my friends. But then, and a big question I wanted to answer is like, okay, this trend of like people leaving Canada for the US because of pay, like primarily because of pay, or maybe like they're the data that I looked into, there's a ton of retirees as well, like wealthier Canadians that want to move to Florida, or they want to move somewhere with like lower taxes where they can settle down and it's warmer. The question that I wanted to answer was, okay, so you can see this trend in, you can see this trend in immigration happening, but is it still happening in 2024 and now in 2025, which was not in this census data? Like it doesn't go up to that point yet. And I was really curious because like, politically things are changing so significantly right now. And then on top of that, it's like not just the general politics of someone like Trump being elected in the first place, but the follow-up of the tariffs and the 51st state. Yeah, even more of a squeeze here. My friend was talking about how even in Alberta, which is a place that's in Canada pretty conservative, and has more people than like BC would that are like Trump sympathetic or maybe fans of Trump from like the Canadian side. He's never seen this level of anger among like all people. People there, my relatives, my friend is saying all of his relatives and his friends, everybody I talked to that lives in Canada is angry. They are like, this is fucked up, that this is happening, like fuck the US. This is kind of what brings us together right now. And the idea of like, he said it's like the highest sense of like national pride he's seen in a long time where it's like, you know, fuck the states, it's like work Canadians. And that plays into people's idea or the appeal of moving into the US too. He was like compared to like a year ago, I think a lot of my- Poison us from the inside. They used to want to poison us from the inside. Now they don't even want to get it. Maybe it's working in our area. We're keeping the Canadians at the end. They all birds are like, how are we going to get over that ditch? It's just a big ditch. I thought it was really interesting to hear him say like, if you asked me or my friends a year ago and offered me a similar salary in the US for some type of job, I might have said yes. But now I would definitely say no. And the difference, but then the over-arcing like economic theme here is like, he was like, but I would still say yes if the pay was like way high. It was double or triple right? And that was like what my cousin was wrestling with too is that she's like, I don't like the political direction of the country. I don't know how long I want to stay here, but my career and my pay is so high here that I can't even talk. So that's kind of what's going on is like, I think my parents are different. They're very proud to be American and they feel like more obligated to defend to the rest of my family like why they live in the States and like why they like chose to live here basically. But the rest of my family is like dogging them for it. They're very angry about the 51st state rhetoric that all of the tariffs and like how they're going to suffer economic. I've got a Canadian friend and I have been making 51st state jokes, obvious jokes right? For a little while now. And recently he's like, hey, I don't think it's funny anymore. He told me just finally he's like, he's like, I know you don't mean it, but like I don't like it anymore because they're because it's seeming more and more serious politically. It seems like, you know, Trump said it as a joke at first and now he keeps saying like, he keeps calling it Governor Trudeau. He just said like, you know, and so they're like, they just don't want to have their sovereignty threatened so regularly. Canada has no nukes, by the way. So I want to bring this up. I think they want to bring up one is that is the craziest outcome that I ever could have expected. Recently, like a few days ago, Canadian politician went to the UK and they're trying to get a deal where the UK's nuclear umbrella applies to Canada. I have a I have a oh my god. So so they're going to like Canada to UK and France to make a world where theoretically the UK would be threatening the United States with nuclear war at the United States and made in Canada. Wow. Crazy. There are things getting. That's how wild. You know, a major turnaround from like a year ago, like what from like two months ago. I didn't expect and that specifically to get involved in this. I didn't expect this to become a Canadian. Were you double guns in this? I'm picking a side. Oh yeah. Okay. A number to reiterate this, which I think is so interesting is like I think I you might have seen this like two decades ago, something like that. The amount of people coming in and out of Canada to the US was like about it was like a few thousand on either side net in a given year. And there was even a year or two where there was more people going into Canada than out and the wow. The most recent tract was like 126,000 right? Or like at least in 2022. 22 right? So like just to give a sense, it is massive. The amount of people who are going from Canada to US two years ago. And then you're right. It's like, is that going to increase? Is that going to get like 20 like this year? Is that going to get even worse because of economic conditions? Like the amount of Canadians who are immigrating to America now is gigantic compared to any amount in the past for like a two to three year period right after COVID. It just like shot way up. Well, no wonder things are getting worse here. There's so many damn Canadians. If they would just stay in their own state. I don't think you should make jokes like that anymore. The friend was a knocked. I thought you were in common. I thought you were in common. I yeah, that's what I'm super curious about is like how that trend is going to hold up in the next like year or two is like what it you know, there's this convergence of like sovereignty and national pride and being wanting to be like I am Canadian like fuck the US converging with like the economic hardship basically. So that's great. I want to bring that that brings us up politically. So you know, you flash backwards one year. Everyone in Canada is so doomer. It's just like it's over right? It's people are depressed. How's the prices do I job too low? They're mad at Trudeau's the they're mad at Trudeau because he did governor Trudeau. And there's fuck Trudeau signs everywhere and it's become a foregone conclusion that him and his party were going to lose. That's the idea. And then this 51st state thing starts happening and it's the most shocking poll. I mean the the conservative government is still leading and I think we'll still win. But it's become like way closer. Okay, this is what I was actually thinking about this. And I'm glad you brought this up because I didn't I hadn't looked this up but I was so curious if polling had picked up for Trudeau's party. Wait, I feel like this is a crazy where he's like defending the sovereignty of the nation. And I think this was in a video you made about how he like boxed one of the people from the other party. And that was a first that was the the first swing in like the his liberal party picking up was him choosing to box someone from one of the other political parties and it he won the fight. And it was kind of like a it was literally like a liberals aren't pussy's campaign. Like it was and and and his polling dramatically picked up and then he found himself in a position of prime minister like a little while after. And it was like this is when he's been making the tweets and these things that I've seen it's like I wonder if the polling is following. He's not running again. So he's getting someone out. I think he did Mark Carney. But yeah, he's just pushing the the liberal party to be where against Trump or fighting back and that's how he's rallying people. Yeah, it makes sense. You know, it reminds me of you know George Bush was a divisive president with pretty low polling numbers by the end. But after 9.11, it was like 98%. It was like the country was united. Yeah. And right now it seems like it's like Rudy Giuliani posted. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So right now, the polling is like really rallying behind it because it feels like from the Canadians, you know, from my side, I still think of it as like it's a little mean spirited, but it still feels like a joke as an American. I don't I can't imagine we have tanks rolling in a Toronto. Yeah. From the Canadian side, it sounds like they're they're like really his stop like really rallying behind this idea of like stop calling us a state, you know, and I would love to get more. I'm not a Canadian. If if King George in the UK kept referring to us as the colonies, I would be pretty annoyed. Yeah. Right. Like he is dropping that like on Twitter every day. I'm pretty fucking pissed. And we want the war. We want we want get over it. George, Jesus Christ. No, that's a good point. I think about that. I just think about it. I'm just thinking about it. I try to dig into my inner Canadian. Like I think you. Yeah. Like it wouldn't it annoys me. It's like it's it feels stupid. It feels like intentionally antagonistic because even though I think there's no realistic path for that becoming the case, also from my perspective as a Canadian, psych even in the world where it somehow happened, maybe there's a dumb thing to worry about. Psychotic that it would all be one state. It's like it's a good. It's best about logistics. Yeah. It's the second thing. It's like continuing the world. And he's like maybe. That's one. Maybe if we respect it's like, all right, we're adding on a nine, nine provinces is states three territories. You know, we respected the Trump look south. He's like, we're thinking of all South America, a 52nd state. That's what I'm saying. It would be insane if it was one day in Congress. It was on today. Already made new people. Not the top priority issue with this, but that's it. That was honestly my first thought when I heard about it. I was like, we just wouldn't be one. It doesn't make me think Trump is probably like most Americans though and does not realize you guys have states that it is it is not just a big city. We have provinces. Oh, it's true. There are provinces and territories. I Trump arguably like no bill peace prize level stuff here in terms of uniting Canada. As a people uniting Europe as a people because they're all terrified now. Of the keys uniting the world. I mean, I've never seen not in the ways bad time historically where Europe wants to spend a whole fuck done money on military. I think that historically is always a good thing. I don't always. We're pleased to piece. And I think I think Trump's really cooking. Germany just got a they had this thing called the debt break where they they can't spend more than their budget. They're breaking it. They're I mean, they're like finally after it's been a long debate. Finally like easing that outbreak to spend 500 800 million billion euros. Sorry, billion on military. They're going to they're going to start doing this military nation of Europe. And I think that's base. That's awesome. It's going to be great. The more the merrier. That's no one. What's he's never gone wrong before? Never gone wrong, dude. I think when Germany militarizes the world's smile. That's the old saying, right? That's yeah, I've heard that. I've heard that saying. I'm not a big student in history. I just sort of go off the vibes. The so the I guess maybe the the last thing that I was thinking about with the the Canada thing is the the 51st state like I can see why it like frustrates people so much. And I've seen something similar with a few Danish friends about the Greenland stuff. They're like interesting. It's gone from like I think when the initial reaction that I got from talking to friends when these things first hit the news was like what the fuck is this guy talking about? It's like this is obviously so dumb. This is like borderline and joke. But then he keeps talking about it. He keeps talking about it. And now people are angry. And I find that it makes sense. Like I'm from from their perspective. I mean, as an American, I'm also not happy with it. Like I don't think. Yeah, that was an interesting one though. It's such a more even more complicated because I feel like the people of Greenland keep saying they don't want to be Danish or American. They want they find on what their own thing eventually right now they're they're still Danish. Yeah, I think that part is more divisive though from my understanding. Right. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I don't know that one that one's tough. I don't know. I think there are a lot of people that are like pushing for Greenland independence from the bit of red and like asked about it sounds like that is just more because there's there's aspects of Danish like society or like social systems that are like so integrated and like Greenland is so reliant on. So people are not like there's there's a big chunk of the population that's not ready to or relinquish there. Yeah. It's just interesting. I saw a good video on it and they talked about how you know because some of the ice caps are melting, the real estate up there is becoming more incredibly valuable. That's what it's going to open like shipping lanes and there's a ton of rare earth metals. But I feel like there's is some sort of global gold rush and I don't fully understand it. I don't I don't know where I stand. I really haven't made up my mind on where I stand on it. But I do think it's complicated given that there's like three distinct parties that I'll kind of want ownership. I think my my general my general opinion on these things is that like in this era of like kind of global free trade like national sovereignty and things like that is like it the there's probably some some other analysis to do here in terms of like the the costs of that system and like deconstructing like the global economics. I believe it. But but in general I think that you know this is led to like unprecedented relative peace and things like that. And we're starting to like pull back the like walls of like these these institutions and rules around like invading and co-opting other countries. I think that's bad because it's like I think that's bad. And because it's such a regression of like what global society is like built around which I think is you know a lot of ways good. And I'm not saying that there's no scrutiny to be had of that sentence either. But it makes me fearful is like okay well if nobody's following the rules anymore and we're going back to old times of invading and taking over. Might make right for every situation. Sacrificing this like economic system that we've that we've made. I don't know the costs of that worry me. There's a good book by Peter Zahehan. I don't know how you say his name. You might but call the accidental superpower. And it's basically about how the global order got set up amongst other things after World War II. And basically the US did this. The US could have continued the previous world order after World War II. And instead was like let's do this global thing. We America will basically make it happen. And we will pay for all the global shipping to be safe. And we will basically institute this order across the world. Astros Astros. And there's something that the US is like they you know in I feel like from a short term perspective. May even have come across as like generous. But it's like I but in the long term like. All right. It was barely in the US. People have come out of poverty. The issue and at least what he talks about in the book. And I think that there's value this is as the is the world has gotten bigger and more complex. It is more expensive to do that. So the one area where there is I don't want to say agree with him. But there's truth to what Trump is saying is like it is not feasible for America to to to police the world order anymore. And that is particularly true with like Russia doing what is doing in China doing what it's doing. And so I don't think the extreme of okay let's pull back from everywhere and just be internal is good because then the whole thing collapses. But there is I think truth to the idea that that order can't go forever. The US is 34 trillion dollars in debt. We cannot afford to police everything in the world. Europe doesn't spend much on military. We do it for them same with you know particularly Germany and Japan right. Like at some point it's not feasible for the US to go in this direction forever. And so I think this is inevitable to agree. It's been what 80 years exactly basically 80 years exactly of the current world order. And Trump is very explicitly trying to tear it down. But I'm not convinced that like if he wasn't there then this wouldn't be in motion. You know what I mean? I grew that. I was going to agree with that. He's accelerating the motion a lot. Yeah. But that is the motion. Like we can't afford this just straight up. It doesn't it can't continue in its current. I guess has to change. That's fine because I'm going to make up my thoughts. Is I think that's super interesting and I like your POV. But you guys talked about it like this was generous or whatever. And in my mind it was like and I'm like a patriot. You know, I would say I wouldn't I was. I was. It's been set up to our benefit. No, I agree with that. It's self-serving. It's self-serving. And I don't I don't think that unwinding it is too our benefit. I think I think I think you're right that as these economies, you know, China is now a bigger trade partner with most of the globe than America. Like the fact that they're not stepping up to this. It doesn't make much. You know Brazil is a much bigger economy. They're always going to be bigger companies. And they want a bigger say and then I think it's going to shift because of that. But I think America trying to unwind it is kind of crazy because it's all helped us. It's all been to our benefit for so long. Like the system NATO, the United Nations. Like we say that we say that Europe is spending too much on or not enough on military because we're spending too much. But it's given us so much power over European decisions. Specifically like if we're like, hey, we want to build our EV industry outside of China. Let's tear off Chinese EVs. Europe just goes along with it. They just do the same thing. Right. Yeah, that's it. They do that because we have. And what's once we once the US unwinds if it continues to happen, you know, I don't think you get it back. Like, yeah, I think there's a particular situation in the world where the US was in this position where all the previous global powers were decimated after World War II, except the Soviet union. They had all the industry. They had all the trade. They were the sole sort of standing, you know, we I guess, the sole standing power. And we're in the position to dictate whatever. Yeah. And there was this argument of like they could have been like, we are going to be the new British Empire. We're going to fuck all y'all. I mean, and instead they they were very kind generous people who we are all thankful for. And that's what we're taking away from it. We're going to get some. Oh, man. Generated and they were a quarter of a quarter. But it puts here they were very generous. Absolutely no meddling. Yeah, zero meddling. Famously. Famously zero. Show me the documents when we met up one time. No, I think that's the yeah, I think that is the pro like I kind of agree with Brandon is like the deconstruction of this is why it's a hard topic to it is hard by the way. It's a hard okay. I'll just I think I'll say it in a more straightforward way. This is a hard topic for me to argue about not at like a personal level. But I feel like there is a conflict as someone who I think I lean like pretty left on like most most issues in general. And I think there's like a maybe a I don't know if I would call my I definitely wouldn't call myself a socialist like outright. But I think there's a socialist viewpoint here where that is also advocating for like deconstruction of this global global order to not for American fiscal reasons but to like dismantle the like systems of oppression that like they they would identify exist across the world among this current system not that oppression and like people being exploited didn't exist before world war two. It didn't exist. And that that level of like American like empire and like control is the it's it's interesting. I don't know. It's it's super interesting because it's like yes that has such a demonstrable positive effect. If you believe in I don't know like getting getting rid of all these things has like such a harm identifiable harm on the US. But there's two there's different perspectives on like why that all needs to be deconstructed and come down. Oh, I think because there's all these different layers of like what people see is the most important outcomes who are the people that need help the most. What would what actions would help those people? The solution is I feel like I'm a very like solution-oriented person and this problem is so layered. It's like oh of course I'm not going to self I'm running my lemonade. Yeah, we're running it. I don't have the answer because I like I like a lot of what like global like our globalized safe economy and society gives me. I like a lot of those things and I also it's you know selfishly benefit from a lot of like the power and control that the US has as somebody especially as somebody who immigrated here and found you know got to make a lot of the ditch. Cross the ditch. Cross the ditch. Cross the ditch. Yeah. Um and but at the same time I feel like I'm I'm wary of you know something like the can the debt grow forever right? If you listen to that one economist who wrote the deficit myth apparently can. Apparently can. Definitely kelton that's an interesting idea. But or but or from other perspectives like maybe you have a strong like moral stance like built in what you'd call like socialist values and you want to see the deconstruction of the global order for those reasons like I don't know I don't know what path I just can't have that take but I can respect it right I can totally see it and make sense you know maybe a loss here is offset by a greater gain in the world if you're all humans benefit the rising time. I get that. I actually have no problem with that. The thing that makes me mad is Americans that don't realize that the reason that a guy managing a buckies in Texas makes more than a European doctor. Yeah. It's because of these systems of power that have America at the core. Yes. Like they think they can vote to dismantle this stuff and it's all I think they're just born better that they're just yeah they're getting they're not and they're going to they're going to feel the punishment from this stuff unraveling as they you know are more and more not protected from equal competition with the globe. So I don't think it's fair I agree it's not fair but I'm saying as an American who wants a certain thing it's crazy to not understand the consequences of dismantling this stuff that's all to your benefit. I do I definitely agree with that. Yeah. Which is that it is not to America's benefit to dismantle this like we have benefited from deciding the global order and then there's if you dismantle it there's like like you said there's arguably not I mean there's all sorts of crazy complex things. I don't think it's great that American spy agencies have picked winners in various countries over the past 100 years. That's fucked up. Like we're just getting aside. The thing about it is like I can't think of a single time at back. Right that's true that's true. The thing about it is like it's just so it's worked out so smoothly so I don't really don't see it's deeply immoral the idea that we do that the CIA simply batted a thousand years. They were kind of the show hey Otoni of government agencies. They went into Venezuela they pitch and bat. The CIA was the Otoni of government agencies fire bar. That is fine. They just keep they just every cool because if they move back if they blow back out of the country. If they'd blown back I'd be critical. I'd be critical. Yeah I think that's what I'm saying is like there's so many I think they're this is why these things are like hard to come to any like solution or determination of I feel like is like there's so many little aspects of like how your lives are impacted by these decisions especially over the long term and it's hard to make confident decisions of like this thing should be this way because I think for the average person including me it's hard to identify the costs like the pros and cons of what those decisions will be. I can tell you that it doesn't matter we don't have to worry about any of that because AI is going to come in and it's going to replace all this. Oh we're getting about the border. We're getting segue. We don't have to worry about the border because all of our jobs are going to be taken by AI is about to explain. Board of podcasts you know you probably at work you think these power points are so exciting. I wish that I could watch a podcast where there's a power point let's look at go. Let's go. We are upgrading podcast technology to the first ever lemonade stand to the future. Hot diggity damn no other podcast has this folks. All right time for classroom so what I was interested in is obviously everybody's talking about AI and how it's going to steal a bunch of jobs or that it's going to make the future incredible and everybody's kind of all over the place on this. What I thought would be interesting as we try to understand what AI is going to do is to look at some of the recent technological waves and what they did for job creation and destruction. Right because it's really easy to be like oh AI is going to destroy X, Y and Z job which is true it's going to destroy a shit load but it's going to create a lot presumably. And so I thought it'd be interesting to specifically look at real numbers of previous technological waves like personal computing. So this happened starting in the 80s let's say and obviously it's continued till now. So personal computing destroyed a lot of jobs. Turns out there's a lot of people who worked on typewriters that don't really exist anymore lost like a hundred thousand jobs. Type setting for people who didn't read old newspapers and stuff you had to manually put like type and print and font stuff to make things right because you didn't just print it. Brandon you're probably like super familiar with that. Just don't make a rumor joke. I was funny because I watched a movie from 93 yesterday and one of the main plot points is this woman trying to get a job as a typist and like yeah just as a whole office people just typing up things other people. It's crazy and that's not even what this is you know in Microsoft word how you can change two words or two letters and it's just changed. You had to physically do that for the entire world operating before a few decades ago right so that's not even the same as a giant amount of people lost work. Clerical and secretarial work. There's three to four million people in the US who just did what you're describing just typing, putting in numbers, spreadsheets because it's all done by hand. If you think of all the finances and all the accounting and all the paperwork of every company in the world they were writing all this by hand bookkeeping, accountants, hundreds of thousands are lost due to spreadsheets and all the different software that PCs introduce right. Office equipment manufacturers we lose tons of that because now all this is consolidated into a computer. So we lose a ton of jobs right based on personal computers and probably a lot of people really upset and scared at that time but obviously computers have generated an obscene amount of new jobs. Programmers alone there's 28 million globally approximately these are estimated numbers from like you know labor bureau but it's you know 20 million globally apparently are working as programmers right now. 28 million people to send to the farms. Yeah we can give it a new programers are on Reddit this is the biggest mistake we've ever made. So some of these it's a mix of whether we have numbers the US or globally PC and parts manufacturing millions of people globally hundreds of thousands just in the US alone of like good jobs of people making parts and if you think about the actual PC itself and all the chips and all the peripherals and all the sales distribution that goes into all the different PCs all the different equipment. I see a networking hundreds of thousands. Do you guys know I used to solder the chips themselves when I worked at Nvidia like they would send me the parts and I would go in my garage. Because we didn't have a computer. And so the chips were made by hands. It was actually the American made operation and I wasn't very fast but that's what it's shorted you. Beautiful and then the outsourced your job to Taiwan that's why you came a stream. That's the story. Fried you up for creative work. Vigil game industry remember that didn't exist when you were a kid. Oh, Brandon. There's 500,000 people who are a job working in the video game industry. Yeah, right. Right. This is this is crazy. We just take for granted that these things exist but these didn't even exist. Same with manufacturing support. If you think about the amount of technicians sales distribution, I mean just Apple stores alone, right? All of these things are based off of this industry that did not exist. The internet comes in. Internet's even crazier, right? Retail stores. Now let's look at what the internet has destroyed, right? Retail stores are super bad, right? They're looking at least 700,000 jobs in the US. Obviously millions globally. As essentially physical stores get totally f- malls get wiped out. Right. And so this is I think more so than the computing one. This is a real like we've all seen and felt this and it's sad. This is not a fun thing, right? And this is now it's going to continue. I was there in Halloween because you're getting a lot of free. Like you're here Halloween. Newspaper and media. Over half of the people working in newspapers and like news update media. They're jobs globally over the past few decades thanks to the internet. We have podcasters now. We do. We as it comes as we'll bring up later turns out there used to be way, way more travel agents and you don't need that if you can just look up what you want to do on the internet. Hundreds of thousands lost. Brokers, financials, advisors, lots of people where the internet essentially just invalidated their job. Can I just say something sorry? Yeah, yeah. Well, my dad has worked in the military for 30 years and then he quit and he works at a military contractor now. He doesn't really like him. He's ready to leave. He's always had this dream of bringing a travel agent and I don't know how to break that snow. No, no, no, no, no. I don't know. I hold it like softly in many ways like, oh, it's cool. But I just don't, doesn't really exist anymore. It's just not based on based on what I've seen in the the East part of LA County. If he can speak fluent Chinese, he can make this. Yeah. That's awesome. That's awesome. There's weirdly a large amount of travel travel agencies like the like the East part of LA County. They're like in Chinese like they're only they're only in Chinese. And this is what we call retraining for a new opportunity. I see. I'll tell my dad we're going to retrain it. Retroling go right now. Yeah. Postal services dropped dramatically, but obviously the internet has created an unbelievable amount of jobs. E-commerce is absolutely massive. Obviously, Amazon doesn't have a great reputation, but it's one point five million people work for Amazon. 200K for Ali Baba alone, millions and millions and millions across the world in logistics and delivery, right? Arguably, every industry in the world has been touched and largely benefited from e-commerce. Cyber security and IT, this is these are industries that are created because of the internet and computing. There's millions globally. Content creation. There are approximately 50 million content creators at least globally, at least two million full time. These numbers are very hard because so much of this is kind of interwoven. But if you think about some of the numbers like TikTok alone has millions of people doing it professionally, right? So it's hard to exactly say, but the estimate is like it's at least 50 million worldwide who are making content to some degree professionally. That is wild. And that's all again, that's 50 million people who weren't doing that two decades ago. I think maybe it's time, maybe a world war three is five. Well, you see that now, but think about how many people love driving Uber. Everybody loves Uber and gig platforms. Again, you can obviously not all of this is sunshine and rainbows, but objectively, demonstrally, there are many, many, many millions of jobs. And if you think about gig platforms like Fiverr or these other ones where people are just freelancing themselves for different roles, I mean, I probably all three of us have worked with people who professionally make YouTube thumbnails or logos or do art. I don't pay them, you know, it's like for me, it's always like exposure. Exposure. Right. Exposure-based economies. What's the formula for adding exposure to GDP? Do we have 3.34 trillion in exposure? We can put it into the treasury. What if Trump tweets out everyone we owe debt to for exposure? They call it even. She. I'm going to make you a star. We've got a slot in the new Mr. Beast video. And then, interestingly, what I thought was particularly interesting, even in traditional media, there was about 4.5 million people in the US who now are working TV film music that weren't there before because the massive amount of additional opportunity that has opened from the internet. Tens of millions of people now are working in media jobs globally that weren't there before. And I'll move through mobile devices pretty quick. This is another very recent tech change. The lost jobs from mobile phone, I'm going to be honest. Just like black people who made blackberry and Nokia digital cameras, that used to be a thing that people buy cameras. You don't do that anymore. You used to buy a Zoom. You don't do that anymore. Taxi services. People used to have jobs making maps. Do you ever heard about the taxi tragedy in New York? Do you know how you need to buy a yellow taxi medallion? Yeah. And the prices of those inflated super, super high because there's a limited amount of them to go out. And then a bunch of people bought a peak market, basically people that are putting their life savings on the line, taking out loans to buy this yellow taxi medallion in New York and then Uber picks up and the price of them plummets. But all those people are locked into the loan that they took out to buy the medallion. Yeah, just crazy, crazy. We need to add a medallion to become a content creator and then that'll fix the problem for the future. We need to limit it. And pull hand out the medallions. You? You? No. You're going to say lemonade, Stan. I guess it should be me. You're going to take on the authority, yeah. So going through this quickly, the app economy as it's labeled like jobs and business and economic productivity that comes from apps on mobile devices is absolutely insane. And I'll briefly touch on it later. There's millions of jobs in the US that benefit from this alone, millions globally. Again, all of this kind of intertwines, right? So it's hard to exactly distinguish what is a phone job versus an internet job. Smart phone manufacturing, there's millions of people who do this worldwide in wonderful conditions. Social media again, like millions of TikTok alone, you know, cloud service. There are millions of devs speaking of somebody who used to be a software developer and has dozens and dozens and dozens of friends in this industry. These are really high quality jobs. These didn't exist. And that's one of the things to note when thinking about job creation and destruction, most of the jobs that are destroyed, not all, most jobs that are destroyed from tech trends are generally not as good as the ones that are created. Obviously, big asterisks there, not everybody would agree with that if you're working in an Amazon, sweat house or whatnot. But like programming, for example, is a really good industry to be in. And so overall, just some numbers on this that I think are pretty crazy. If you look at these trends, PC, personal computers in the US, thanks to PC estimates, are we lost four to six million jobs and made 20 to 30 million, right? We're talking like a 20 million increase potentially globally. Same thing, tens of millions of jobs increased going to internet. Again, hard to exactly quantify, and there we go, millions of jobs destroyed because of the internet, right? And then we're making tens of millions. It continues to benefit essentially every business on the planet. Globally, hundreds of millions are likely either directly employed through internet services or benefiting from them, mobile devices, destroyed millions, made millions. And so what's also interesting about this is when these trends happen, generally, they destroy a lot of jobs early in the wave, and then they create the jobs later. If you think about mobile devices, right? Like, it's destroying Nokia and Blackberry right away, but it took time for Uber to pick up, and it took time for TikTok. It took a decade, two decades for TikTok. So generally, the trend is the destruction happens quickly early on, and then the creation of jobs happens later. Quick other notes that we'll talk about, I'll get back to the desk. New tech obviously affects all industries. There's a McKinsey study that said the internet has created 2.6 jobs for every one destroyed. That's wild. Mobile apps account for 20% of all new US jobs from 2008 to 2022. That's crazy. Mobile apps are like crazy good at generating new jobs for Americans. It's like Uber, right? It's like Uber. Am I assuming? I mean, that's crazy. Yeah, but if you, I see often think about like every single business, banks, a huge portion of what they're doing with their energy resources staff is mobile bank. Building for mobile banks. There's so much that goes into mobile devices. It's not just, you know, all of some guy made a meditation app, right? It's all these things. It's games, it's gig economies. It's the fact that every single business also now has a major mobile company. I wish Twitch would hire some of these people for their mobile app because it sucks. Yeah, yeah, it's nice. Well, we created some jobs there. We created some jobs not at Twitch. Kind of a big fan of how you just have a 30% success ratio on loading the clip. I open a Twitch clip and it likes to go up sometimes. That's crazy. Oh, crazy. The new job will fix that. Great, great. Some jobs. Obviously, in this is maybe we get into this in a future episode or now, but there's a lot of ethical ramifications to new technology. I'm simplifying this to just job creation and destruction for the sake of like narrowing the scope of this conversation. But obviously, if some, you know, if somebody in rural Brazil has access to resources, which I believe AI will do, that allows them to access businesses or opportunities that they couldn't before. I think the internet has largely been a massively positive thing for people around the world. There's also downsides though. A lot of jobs have been shifting towards gig work, which I think many people do not feel is nearly as sustainable. And locations of jobs shift as well, right? It's not like every job that's destroyed, like grows in that same spot, like a plant, right? In rural Arkansas. You might have roots. Then losing jobs in rural Arkansas, a lot of those jobs then go to Silicon Valley, right? So this is not evenly distributed. And I had some ideas. Maybe AI future, there could be virtual worlds and experiences. We don't know what's going to happen with AI yet. I believe there will be crazy ass stuff. AI run public service sectors, imagining like traffic lights and utilities actually being managed by really smart AI's who optimize this. More scientists who can use AI's to run experiments, genetic engineering and customized medicines, like the healthcare industry being far more sophisticated with people and cyberpunk, where we all have cool ass fucking additions to our head and our face. And you think about this alone? Dude, serious note, that is going to happen. If you imagine that number of industries and people in the show before, I didn't watch the end, I assume it's a happy ending. If you think about the number of industries in the world that are around fashion and people expressing themselves in interesting ways, the millions of people who do little Etsy crafts, the millions of people working in fashion or hair styling or tattoos, different ways to express yourself. And you imagine in the future, as we will get essentially bionic parts of our self, the amount of customization and flaring personalization, one of the things that I think is interesting, we all laugh about the metaverse and stuff like that. But as virtual worlds become really, really sophisticated, people are going to do crazy stuff. And maybe there's going to be a whole industry where you manage a bar in a virtual world in a way that you couldn't before, right? So I really do believe that there's going to be enormous, crazy different types of technologies and industries that we can't even imagine right now that come from AI, specifically as part of this product wave that will happen largely after the current wave of destruction. This is oversimplifying things, but I think it is very interesting. And now I will go back to the table and we'll talk and eliminate it. Okay, yeah, I'm going to say, I want to talk about it. This is very interesting. The first thing I want to say is I think it's cool to have a techno optimist who can articulate your points on spot cast because I think the vibe I get from my audience, especially when I'm talking to them and they're younger people in America most of them is dumors, right? They're very dumber. Yes. And I don't know necessarily where I stand. I'm going to bring up some points they might make, right? I'm going to, when I talk to you, but I think it's cool that you have this idea because I don't like the idea that everyone is constantly dumber in general. I think it's like it's self-serving. So self-defeating, self-portee, it's a bad snowball. Yeah, I think in the same vein, we did a test recording before this episode last week and we talked a bit about, I think that feeling or that anti-AI sentiment may be among our audiences collectively or maybe young people in general being so negative, I think has valid points at its base. I think also what hurts is a lot of people at the forefront of the face of people who are fans of this stuff is often the people who, I brought up the tweet that was that guy who was really excited about fully AI movies and we'll be watching fully it's like, that's not really why I consume art. That's why it's defeating the purpose. Finally, we're offloading art. The big load of our collective human mind for so long. There's a really good, really good, dog roast clip, the comedian of him being interviewed. I think by Theo Vaughn and he's talking about, isn't this fucked? The AI is taking all the art and we're working in the Amazon warehouses. This doesn't make any sense. This isn't what we want. I think when these things get talked about, because the positive outlooks for me, when I read through, for example, you sent an article from a while back or a sub stack of the very, very, very good piece of that, all the potential benefits of AI and the first section was all about health and the way it could help diagnose and deal with modern health issues. I was like, that is exciting. That is awesome. I think that's the, when you talk about these things, being sensitive to those concerns, or maybe not, I don't even think sensitive is the right word, is being ready to answer those concerns with good positive answers. Those things are important because I feel like the sentiment is so overwhelmingly negative. Let me address that really quickly. I think part of what I mentioned in my important PowerPoint documentation is the fact that with tech trends, with major technology waves, again, you generally see job destruction at the beginning and then the new industry start to emerge. I think that I agree. There's a lot of doom or is on with AI right now. It's justified if you're just looking at what's in front of you, which is right now it is destroying artist jobs straight up. That's what I wrote. I wrote this down is I think that people get really caught up in the short term cost of situations like this because it's very visceral. It's very, it's happened in front of you. It's hard to do if it's your job or it's your failure. Exactly. I'm not saying that people, I can't look at, it's like, I'm fucking, I'm a podcaster. And I can't look at the guy, the guy who worked down. Who were the writers that got laid off. I think I was listening to a story on the daily about manufacturing in America and this guy who had worked at a lock company, like a lock manufacturing company. And after decades of working there, he loved his job. He lost it because they off, they offloaded all the manufacturing like or outsourced it to another country and he lost his job. And there's a huge part of his identity that was lost. He lost his income. And it was standing outside the factory instead. And it was standing outside the factory instead. Well, the, the law firm is actually going to sell. Yeah. And I think when talking about these things, something that I think about a lot is like overall, in order for society, like a small scale example of this is in business. I remember hearing an anecdote about how a lot of like tech early tech companies and tech would be worried about their products cannibalizing each other. And Steve Jobs like notably said when I think the iPhone came out that he had no, like he had no fear of this. Like in order to progress the products in the company forward, you cannot be afraid of like cannibalization basically. And I think at like a society level, the idea that like you can't replace old jobs. Like, oh, what, what you've got to keep the horses and boggies. Okay. We can't get it. I want to jump in because okay, I agree, like I am not a nutite by any, I don't follow Ludwig nor. I'm not a Ludwig. I'm not a Ludwig. I'm not a Ludwig. I'm not a Ludwig. I'm sorry about saying that. I hate this guy. Let me just, if it was any other technology, my instant response is exactly what you said. I know that if you invent the tractor, some guy loses job, but the farm gets bigger. We get whatever. Whatever. I know always historically, I think people are maybe not correctly and nobody really knows, but are intuiting that AI is a little bit different. That it feels different because it feels like the first time where maybe you just don't need a human at all. Maybe it's like, it's not that we're making this thing convenient so the human can do a higher order task. It's like the human has now truly been lapped. And I'm not saying AI is there yet. I'm not, I don't know exactly where I stand on this. That's what I think it's like. This one's different is what I'm trying to say. And I want you to question on that because this one feels to me different than I have thoughts. If you want to add on it before I respond, yeah. Yeah. And that's why there's a, there's a CGP gray video from like a decade ago about this, not necessarily about AI, but about automation in general. And like why this leap in technology is different from previous times, ultimately. And I think if that is the case or that's something that we worry about, I think something I think a lot about is like, well, if it's going to reach that point and you, you might disagree with that is how you change like society and legislation and things around jobs to accommodate for that. Because at a certain stage, it's like the way day to day life works and like jobs work. If that's going to be the case, if the human is going to be like, lapped and replaced for labor, then the structure of society also needs to start changing. I think I'm just curious, I'm curious what your response is to him and like also what you, what you think about that. Yes. And again, to set the stage for people, maybe I am very optimistic on AI. I do think the net positive on earth is going to be extremely high and for humanity. However, there's going to be a, it's going to be more destructive in the short term than any other technology probably. And I think a lot of people are concerned about that, even the optimists like myself. So three kind of categories. I think one, there's this idea of like, we're going to destroy all these jobs. This will happen. This is going to happen quickly. And there's going to be a time lapse before new industries are created that can fill some of that space. However, I think people are overplaying the amount at which a company will simply fire the people that they can replace. So imagine you have company A, B, ABC, you have company ABC. They make a hundred products a day. And then with A, company A, company A, company A, company A, company A, company A, you know, actually, it's good. Company A and company A, okay? Two different companies. You guys both employ a hundred people, okay? You play a hundred people, okay? And then you realize with AI that each person in your company can be twice as effective because instead of just completely changing their jobs, every person's job for the most part in most offices, at least, is a mix of different skill sets. And people realize that they can actually replace certain amount of work with AI and it allows them to do more. So each person can now get twice as much done. Okay. You, given just your background and your nature as a human being, you fire half the people immediately. You think I don't need half of them. And I can replace them, right? If they're all working, fucking fire them, right? And you know, and you go home and you get in your fancy toy to pre-iss and you're very proud of yourself. Leave them to the dog. Age your eye. You notice the same thing. Now what? There's two options. There's two options. There's two options you could do here. I mean, you can use only one option. Oh, it's fire. Fire them all. Oh, fire them all. Yeah. And I'm out. I sell the stock. So I sell it to a private equity firm and I'm on Bermuda Beach by the way. Yeah. Now, what I believe most companies will do is go, my employees are twice as productive. Let's make twice as much stuff, right? Why would your reaction be, yeah, let's fire everybody and do the same amount instead of if you are a material science company or a manufacturing company or a software company and suddenly your employees are twice as effective as they were before. They can produce twice as much because AI can do so many of the tasks that simply took time before. Why wouldn't you make twice as many things? If you are a business, you want to make more money, you want to succeed in the market, you can free up some of those people to develop new products to be competitive in these other areas. Why wouldn't you grow? Every company is incentivized to grow. Obviously, there's individuals who won't do that. There's going to be horrible leaders who are like, yeah, fuck all the human beings, they're going to be profit driven. But in general, even if you take this very, very cynical capitalistic, they're just doing it for money. Even in that case, I believe the vast majority of the time, the incentives are to make more. And that's the hope is that what this does is it enables all people and businesses around the world to be more effective, more productive. I've seen this in my own life. I've talked to dozens of people for whom AI has made their writing better, their plan and better people who are now able to do businesses in a way they weren't before, tackle taxes better. There's going to be so many fewer barriers to people starting businesses and creating things because AI's will allow everybody to engage with this. It's going to destroy a lot of jobs, but it will hopefully allow people to make more. And that means not just firing everybody, it means doing more stuff and each person is more productive. And of course, this is also going to happen with a lot of job destruction. There's going to be a lot of people who use this in a very evil way. There's going to be a lot of people in certain areas who then can't recover and get the opportunities that are created. But I think that fundamental idea of if you can replace, if a person becomes more productive, you fire everybody, is flawed. My, I mean, my first, I think I definitely agree with like parts of what you're saying. My first response to that, your original, original idea is that like the demand doesn't necessarily exist for more to exist, right? So at some point, it's like, well, if I can't, if demand does not match this like shared increase in output that my company has and all the other companies in my industry are also choosing to make moves that are similar and increase their productivity, well, eventually I do have to let people, let people. So the quick counter offer, and again, obviously these are things are complex, but compared to five decades ago, people have far more leisure opportunities now, right? There are literally every day, if somebody's listening to this podcast, presumably you are picking between literally thousands of different options on your TV devices, video games of what to do every day. The amount of leisure options are massive and these industries have exploded and we are currently benefiting from it. None of these existed five decades ago, right? And probably those people were like, oh, if everybody started being five times as productive, what are we going to do with our time? Well, it turns out we as humanity have a huge portion as I was pointing out. Yeah. I just want to drill down on the question. No question, though, because I fully agree that if it's like artists versus artists plus AI, that second one's more productive. Yes. I get it, but I don't know what happens when there's the leap of why have the human part of it at all. I guess I don't understand that a human can't be completely lapped to the point where they are cut out. Maybe you have one human as a overseer or manager, but I don't see, I see the transitional period. That's what's happening right now. Riders with AI can research stuff really quickly and it's great. They're improved. Sure. But I don't see what happens when I don't need to hire a writer because I hire people for a video. And if they use AI, they can get stuff that I don't see what happens when the like, because AI just feels to me different. That's what I'm saying. It just feels, it feels to me like it's better at all of the human things. So I don't, it's like almost inconvenient to have a human. Maybe, maybe, I have a thought. The direction, the direction that you're thinking in is, is, I could still be small scale in the past. In the past, like changes in technology or tools or automation, free up the time of the human that couldn't do that job before. So they could like move on and like do something else. But in this case, if like the AI goes far enough or the AI is good enough, whatever task or job that the human could move on to next. The AI would just also be able to do. And that is like the, the, maybe what's different is like the chain you get stuck in. It's like, there's no new ship to jump to anymore. Right. Because the AI can also always do that thing. Yeah. And obviously there will always be like exceptions. I truly believe there will always be exceptions to the rule in that like we have, I think there's an underlying desire to like connect with people and like, like, there's, there's, there's still that. That's what I'm worried about as well as like there's, there's, there's, I told you get stuck. I get what you guys saying. I want to make a counterpoint to my own point. And just like argue against myself is that, you know, people said this about chess when computers got better than humans at chess, completely better. There's, there's no human on earth that can be even like a calculator, not like a, like a phone at chess. It gets better. Chess has never been bigger. People, you know, at the end of the day, still want to watch humans play. They still enjoy the art and sport of it. And the entire industry of chess has never made more money nor been bigger than decades after computers laughed humans. So I don't think it's unreasonable so they can happen for a lot of things where AI is completely better than all of us, but we still want to do a human thing. We want to watch a human made play or a movie or whatever. I get that. But for the totality of industry, so many things are just profit driven and they will pick the best option. And I'm worried that if humans are not involved in that, I even agree with you that it could be a good thing, but we have to restructure society. Our system, I don't think, will work in that situation. That's, that's, yes. Okay. So I basically agree with that. And it is possible. I just think broadly, we should trust that in the long term, we as humans when given opportunity find things to do and create new things. So I think that in this case where let's say you described, well, this writer that you would normally hire is outsourced to an AI and you're not hiring that person at all. So what does that person do now? He has free time and energy and you imagine that he's now just a drift in the world, but he's a drift in the world where AI is incredibly capable of doing creative things, right? And he would have access to the same tools to go make things, to make a new business, to create leisure opportunities, to go find something and build one of these new industries that I think will exist. So I think what is, is sometimes lost is the assumption that the benefits of AI are only going to go to certain people. But if you assume that every human gets these same things, that even if a person is pushed out of a particular type of market, that we should not assume that we as humanity won't create new ones. And I think, I agree society will need to be restructured. There's a possibility it's just all a shitload of pain and I hope that's not the case and I'm somebody who thinks I'm optimistic because I think the good can be so incredibly good. And the bad is very possible and we need to like fight against the bad. But do you, like you know what I'm saying though, right? I do. Yeah. That's, I think it's, it's, that world is terrible up until we do have all, and like probably a lot of our economic system and what people do is around human leisure and creativity. And that I don't think AI's can replace. At least in its entirety. That part, I mean, that part I agree with that those are the parts that we want to like emphasize and not let go of. I think that the issue that I can think of is like a, like a lot of new technology, policy and the way society works does not catch up very quickly with like the reality is or the pace of technology. So like what I get worried about in the US, something that I can think of is the cost of the person who loses their job to AI or automation or or a factory being moved abroad or anything like that situation is the cost of losing your job in that scenario or the cost of losing your industry on the whole is very dire. Like you, you lose your, you could lose your home, you could lose your ability to support your family. The social systems in place to support that person are not very good. And I think the pace at which the technology is accelerating right now does not leave a very good safety net for the people that are like caught in the crossfire. You are definitely right. You need to restructure things so that we have a way for people to transition to this new world. Yeah. And we don't have that right now. And if this happens without any of that other support system coming in, it will be very awesome. Chaos. It will be very good. Yeah. And I think the incentive structure that is like building AI right now and like building the technology is sort of this, say, capitalist system, like even in China, right? Like they're, they're using private companies to develop and like develop a lot of like merit to that approach, right? Giving private companies the ability to explore and innovate and that's like very powerful. I don't think those companies necessarily share the incentive structure that saves the people that are like the externality basically. Yes. Yes. And that's what I get worried about basically is like. Yeah. And that benefit and society in the most idealistic version of what you're talking about could be really, really good. But the guy who like lost his job to AI along the way, his like he might have lost his job, gotten a divorce, gotten addicted to government. And the government has not caught up. I mean, I'm sorry. I'm making it dramatic. No, they're just making the saddest possible story. But I'm making it dramatic. But then this is true, right? People who have lost their manufacturing jobs in like middle America and their life crumbles because like that was their identity. They can't get a work. People are attached to like the places they grow up and they turned to things like like drugs and like drug addiction and like there's a huge spike in like, not a drug addiction suicide, like all those things, right? These things like compile and affect each other and that externality of the people affected by this race to create technology is what I worry about. I don't want to leave the cure for Alzheimer's at the door that AI could bring for example. I don't want to leave that behind either. One of the hundreds of thousands of people get injured or die every year in car accidents in the US alone, which would be prevented by self-driving cars. Prevented by maybe changes like this. Right. Right. Right. There's only, like we just, I want there to be a conscious recognition of the costs and positive of both things and do our best to manage this. Yeah. To be very clear, I'm an AI optimist. I believe the net positive will become extremely high for humanity and getting to that high could be a super rocky road and there needs to be a lot of support and basically thoughtfulness on how it's done. Yes. Absolutely. Yes. What you're describing is super possible, frighteningly possible. I would say even though I firmly believe 30 years from now, we're all going to go holy shit. The world is so much better because of the AI. And I hope so. Something a smaller version of this that I was thinking of, I watched this video breaking down like, uh, France is like relative economic position in Europe right now. And they have like very high productivity, but also low hours worked per week. So their overall like economic output seems like lower or comparable to a lot of, a lot of Europe. But when you look into the problem, it's actually, oh, the French people because of the like the rules and the laws they have set up, they actually just work less and they have like more time in life for other things. And their society, like their pop, populous of workers is very productive and uses that time very effectively. Like that's, that's what I would, that's an example of what I would want to push towards, right? Right. Yeah. I mean, you guys brought up two points that are, are very interesting, which is you talked about saving lives from, uh, cars being able to self drive, for example, crash. And you mentioned jobs and it's like 37 of 50 states, the number one job is truck drive, the number one job. Yeah. And the second self driving trucks are good, all those jobs, that's going to be your, that's that's probably the biggest inflection point of chaos from all this. That's going to be, I mean, it's going to be really, really bad. Yeah. And that, and that there was a three years of Andrew Yang campaigning. It's a size and it won't basically, uh, that's actually, that was, that was his platform, right? It's like, I don't disagree with that. Um, I don't know if I think Andrew Yang would have been the best president ever, but I think that feet, accounting for that and that's coming. I really agreed with him on it. Yeah. Uh, yeah. He's the only politician I've ever donated to. And then I regret it because they still text me all the fucking time. I'm like, dude, it's been like 10 years. Go stop. Andrew Yang is not going to be president. Like, yeah, I mean, obviously there's so much to go into and I'll keep bringing the stuff up because like this is like, talking about these types of things is one of the biggest reasons I'm excited for this show and excited to talk with you guys because this is so deeply complex and so impactful. And I can see in my own life, like, as an example of the people who are doing this, I employ like 10 to 15 people on a, on any given basis, I do that because AI is enabling to be, enabling me to be more productive. I am able to code more things. I'm able to get more creative ideas out there and I've used that, I've used that success to hire more people who are now supporting my creative visions. And there are real world examples right now already where AI is allowing creative people to grow and expand what they're doing and hire more creative people and make more stuff. And I think in a lot of cases, that's going to happen and it's not always going to be the capitalist asshole who's like, and I like capitalism, but you know, the capitalism is good at incentivizing people to be shitheads and the shitheads are going to be shitheads, right? That's going to happen. And this, we'll talk about another episode. This is why deep seek, which is an open source is super important because open source is going to prevent companies like Microsoft from hoarding this all themselves and preventing it from benefiting the broader people. Like I think that is critically important, but it's too big of a topic and I'll stop there. Well, I'm, again, like I said, I'm glad you're talking about it because I do think there's many, many, many people, especially a little watch the show that don't see that side of it. They don't even have both sides of the argument. They have one side of the argument and they're really deep into it, which makes sense when what you're looking at in front of you is a fire. It's a fire in front of you. And the guys like, no, no, no, once the forest burns down, it's going to be vibrant, bro. Like, yeah, no, I get it. Like, it's easier to say, well, we're in good comfortable positions. Yes. Also, but I think it's fair. And I think it's interesting. And I, I want to talk to you more because I want to share that optimism because I don't like the idea that this technology is so different that I should just be sad. You know what I'm saying? Like I like, I, I have used, um, I for research, it's been helpful. Like I think, I think I'm close to where you're at, but I still have a major research that I can just see the pain that it's going to cause. Like, guarantee you're going to cause some people. Absolutely. Yes. It's going to be more destructive than any previous. I'm not saying you're getting more pain than anyone. And that's me when I invite Aiden to something. And he flakes on me. This is what I've been really staying up at night over. A truck on real. Can you tell me about what's going on with the culture and whether people are canceling? Absolutely. Look, I get that A.A. is going to be disruptive. But I think it's way more disruptive to have an event like a fun dinner or something. Oh, I know. And then Aiden cancels on you last minute. Oh, hang on. And uh, business insider did a very interesting. You tell us straight and write fuck Aiden on that, please. Yeah. You write fucking. This thing on the rise of cancellation culture, which is basically they interviewed some people that did some studies and it looks into the idea that people now more than ever have been flaking. They've been, they've been, it's a post COVID thing. People have been more than ever resorting to the, you know, that good feeling you get when you're an event you don't want to go to in the last second you cancel on it. Well, people have called that, you know, self care or whatever. This study goes into the idea that, hey, it's actually kind of negative long term for your mental health for our ability to form friendships for our loneliness. Like there's a loneliness like a pandemic. It shows average time spent alone is like at an all time. And we had the COVID peak and then it dropped a little bit and it's going right back up. Like people are compared to the decade before COVID astronomically lonely. They're astronomically more alone, more time at home, more time ordering in more time. And I wanted to get a sense from a serial cancel or like, it's actually a joke. I actually want to get your thoughts because you are somebody who I think is the exact opposite of this. You like make a point to do all this stuff and do a lot of social events. I have a high sense of guilt about canceling to be honest. Yeah. So I wanted to get your sense of whether you thought that was a benefit to you or why you do it. Because I think there's a lot of people who fall into this mindset that they talk about here, which is like, it can feel so scary or anxiety inducing or whatever. To just leave your house sometimes, it's so comfortable. We have built really houses to ourselves lately. And why it's worth it to leave. I got one, you just sort of make the pitch because you're the one I think does it the most. I, you know, I think we get them out. I go out, but like I tried out video games. Yeah, I'm making sure awesome. And I don't know. And I like my reading and like watching stuff. So I want to hear from your POV why you're so against this. Why? Why this is not your attitude at all? I mean, I've, I think I have actually dealt with this. And this was a big thing coming out of COVID that I thought about personally because before COVID, I think I was a person that had abundant social energy. I got a lot of like joy and energy from going to social events and hanging out with other people and talking to other people. And I felt like after COVID, I actually am a different person in that regard. I think it, I developed a sense of. I don't know if I would use the word anxiety or dread about like going to social events that I had planned, even though whenever I go, whenever I get there, it's always good. Like, I've never regretted going to anything that I've like committed to. And I really, I spent a lot of time thinking about it because I felt like a different person. I felt like I lost part of me coming out of that. And I want it. I was like, is this part of getting older or is this because I just effectively spent a year and a half at home? And that was a really tough question that I think I really, I still have an answer like fully. I think the guilt or like where the desire to like show up comes from or like why I hate canceling is because I know it's annoying for the other person. It's just to be canceled on for sure. You know what's funny is like, I don't mind. I don't mind that. Really? Yeah. But I find that's like pretty rare. It's like, I know the other person if I cancel is like probably going to give me shit or like, will they'll be sad? Or I think something that I think about a lot is I know that if I cancel on the same like group or person like a few times in a row, you'll stop getting invited to things. And I don't want to stop being invited. So being a friend and participating like is saying yes and showing up even when you have that feeling of like not wanting to go. And then like I said, whenever you actually get there, it's great. There's been so maybe never when once you get through the discomfort of like the plan and going that and I have a bunch of I have a bunch of other thoughts related to this topic too. But that's the main thing is like I, I think about how it would make the other person feel and I also think about the social consequences of what saying no often means. And both of those things like are just hurt in the long run, right? They hurt your relationships with people. And that's funny that the article talks about that because that's. Is it? Is there underpinning? What is the like, or what are some of the theories about why? Because I like, I'm curious why we wouldn't have bounced back now that it's been a couple years. So the big two, they have the article are this busyness culture, this idea of like people feel busy or than ever they feel like they have to climb the economic ladder more. They feel like there's, you know, we're in a spot where jobs are harder to get. And it's trying to be a little bit performative busy and also is busier. So the idea that the first thing you can cut is time with friends. You can cut the, the superfluous stuff that you can always. I thought that was a really good, they put it in a really nice way is that we don't, that culture doesn't place your time spent with friends or time spent as leisure as like a prior or as a priority or as an integral part of your life, but it is. Yeah. That is a meaningful part of part of your life. And in one way, it might be the most meaningful part of what it's all for. It also talks about that, right? The literal meaning of life coming from that. Uh, so there's that. And then there is more anxiety. So again, people just self-report dramatically more anxiety. They think their friends like with sense COVID. You're saying right? Okay. So people, uh, were poor thinking their friends want to hang out with them less than they do. Like if you asked the friends, they would say 80 to 85% or whatever, the people would say 40 to 40. Like they would people are generally more in their own heads. They think they're less important to social events that they go to. They think they don't need to be there. They also think that, um, you know, if you have a friendship with somebody, if I cancel on you, my general thought would be like, we're friends. It doesn't matter. And it probably doesn't. But what this article goes into is like, it's sort of done. Like it does add up over time. All these lost encounters are, are like deposited in a friendship bank that aren't earning interest. You're not paying into that bank. And over time, you're, you're savings at retirement or a lot. Yeah. And that's like a real kind of answer to the thing as well. Like socializing is how you get most opportunities. You know, it's how you expand. Anyway, yeah, yeah. Like all the best things in life, it's not necessarily the party itself. It's the person you meet there that leads to the thing, you know, I'm really shocked by the level of inertia that a year and a half of I know, I'm so glad I wasn't a student at the time. I just feel like, yeah, it feels like it was, it wasn't. Dude, I think it's going to be so, I think it already is so bad. Like it has such resounding negative social effects as like outline through something like this, but just anecdotally, like I think, and I think about like what a transformative and like important part of my life, like those years were, like end of high school beginning and like through college. And even just like learning, like I think I wouldn't have learned very much if I wasn't in classroom. But then also going out to like parties and meeting people and like making friends and doing stupid shit, like that is all, I don't know, like that's how you, that's how I learned things about myself. It's how I like made mistakes that drastically changed my like value system and like how I behave like it's such an integral part of of life. I think you've got two years of Zoom school in like junior senior college or high school, you to get your money. It's not fair. You didn't get anything or even close to what I think you deserve or what you were earned. Um, I don't know if you guys feel this too is like I, I was thought a lot about like bringing this up because I feel a little like I'm going into old man mode complaining about ex generation, but I think it's not actually the generation below me. I think it's a lot of the people like around my age as well, like a little older than me younger and then definitely the younger generation too is like talking to people in like public spaces feels like pulling teeth and like the level of like conversation, a bill, conversational ability of somebody like age 35 and below is so poor and it's kind of why genuinely it's kind of why I think I've always liked talking to adults and older people like adults when I was kid and but older people in general is because if you go up to any per I feel like if you go up to any person above the age of 40, they can have a conversation with you. And I think this is also, this is also like a cultural. This feels too general, but I, you've done it more than anyone. So no, I think this is also a cultural thing in that, um, I wonder how COVID and things like this and people's anecdotal experiences playing, playing to this, but I've found like going to compared to the US and also compared to Canada, uh, going to like the UK and Australia, like the average young person there that you meet is like also better at having a conversation with you. Like they feel more socially comfortable just like interacting with strangers, which is a little odd to me. Like I wonder what it is about like the way people are growing up and like going through their lives now that makes like baseline socializing so difficult. It's got to do with practice because everything is like if they're not getting practice and they get more anxiety and it's a snowball. Yeah, and it stacks and like COVID, I feel like COVID like makes something like that so much worse. And it makes like the, uh, like making plans and like showing up to them makes it feel like such an ordeal in a way that it wouldn't be normally. This, uh, this thing talks about striking of conversation with strangers and how it says, you know, if, if you're thinking about, hey, when I say something that's stranger, you get nervous and don't want to think they're going to, they're going to think I'm annoying. Yeah, but if someone does it to you, generally, you're like, oh, this is going to cool. Like when it's like fun. Exactly. But it's a, it's a mismatched reward system. I did that at a coffee shop this week. You do it all the time. I thought it's hard to do it. You actually do it too much. You are the annoying one. No, I don't know. There's not Uber drivers. I'm tired of this car. I'm not thinking I don't want to. I've set this person set something anyway. Uber drivers, hey, when you talk, the one, the one more thing I was thinking about with this was the, I feel like a big thing that maybe changed more post COVID too is like, and something that maybe is really pervasive and like American like work culture is I feel like the fluidity of socializing matters a lot. Like people used to move less, people used to like just hang out more by default. Like they, I think they talk about it in the article, like the percentage of Americans that report they have a best friend is like, way down 30 year low or something or it's used. Yeah. I think people lack a, I think the making plans and like hanging out with people is increasingly a task you have to do versus how it used to be. That's how I feel is like you, I think a lot of people like grew up or were in community spaces were hanging out happens like very naturally. You're not necessarily making a plan. You just have to be around each other, right? And then you just do something together. But now making plans turns it into like a task, which I think when like people are so busy with things like work, it's not like an enjoy, you don't enjoy making the plans, so to speak. And you don't enjoy the build up to how you get there and like figuring out the logistics and all those things. You enjoy actually hanging out. So when like we as people have so many barriers between us to hanging out by default and then you build, you add the anxiety and the isolation on top of that. I wonder how much of the inertia that is like the difficulty in people ramping back up into the previous lifestyle is the fact that tech has gotten really, really good at keeping people's attention. Right. It's got a lot of talks gotten. Yeah. And again, I want to be clear. I don't think every tech is good. I think there's plenty of obvious downsides. And like, you know, if you think about COVID, it's like a year and a half where every single person making entertainment on the in the world got a chance, they got to shot it everybody. You know, like everybody is like, I'm going to take, I like me. I captured like 200, 200 million people, dude. I fucking caught them like Pokemon and they have a lot. And like, back to him into a corner and like, I probably so many of my viewers are like, would be hanging out with their best friend right now, but they're like, oh, well, Doug dropped the video. They couldn't escape it. Now they buy my months. Yeah, they buy my months. Not can make it. I made it a way I can't. My character. My character calls me a bus call. This is called a bus call. No, that's, I think that's a huge part of it is like it might be. It's like glue, like we put like cow trops all over the ground and they have to like crawl over them to get back out to a non digital social life. You know, so funny if you talk about co with anyone who's not a creator, they're always universally negative, but then contractors have to do that thing where they're like, you know, yes, it's bad. Like all three numbers like 10x, like just three, just three merchants of death and yeah, I just don't know millions. I mean, you gotta it worked out so well for him. I just don't think the sacklers should have to pay that much. No, I think you're I think you're right. Fentanyl damage panel. It's all the sack. Like three different opinions. We like we like put them all in like a mirror maze and it's like, look, normal life is outside the mirror maze, but you got to find your way out. You know, you got to get out. And we got a lot of pop ups. I would like if like for the people listening, I would love people's opinions about like how they've dealt with this and like how they they feel about this because it's something that is so not just like the cancellations themselves, but this like general topics, like how did COVID like affect you socially? How do you feel about socializing now? Something I think about a lot is it wasn't just I tried to dive. I was excited to go to big events and socialize and be out again once you could. And I remember feeling so fatigue in a way that I wasn't before. It was harder, not just and like I said, I enjoyed being there, but being there was harder than it was before. And that was a strange feeling to me. And I don't I don't know why. I think harder and I also want to give one more note because we don't talk about this because because of being kind of better there guys, but it's also more expensive. Like I heard this right. I talked to people about it. I talked to my old friend J Whits who was you know, you still got a lot of basketball games. He told me like it's got a family now. It's just really expensive. Like it's just everything's like the prices have gone way up. It's hard for him to get out. And I think when you talk to a lot of young people, especially it's like every restaurant is expensive. You know, a lot of things that normally would be a good third place have become monetized and more expensive. And so they're they're running out of spots. Now I don't think that I think I still a little bit of a cop out in that you can always find something cheap to do. You can always I think a lot of things. I think it's that. It's a battle bus. But that's that's part of it. Even that. It's another it's another layer of friction. It's another layer of work. I don't that you need to figure out. Instead of just hanging out something. I you know what the office working at the office is really nice because conveniently I work at a company I work at a company with friends and the people who are around and come to do stuff at the office is like we just hang out and talk in in social. Play Mario Kart. We like it. I was a great and play Mario Kart. We have the mind and phone on and don't talk to anyone. But I. I want to be clear. I've been to the office many times. 98% of the time you are locked in headphones in no talking anybody play Mario Kart. We. It's not it's not a dead of socialization. I'll show you my I'll show you my latter page. I'll show you Ela. I'm a hot straight right now. But having those spaces is so important. Like having having spaces where you can just be around people to begin with. So the layers of friction don't have to happen between and I think like I be curious to if if people back this theory up at all. But I feel like a lot of other countries up into even in the modern day of technology, even post COVID like culturally different places don't seem to deal with this problem as much. And I'm sure things like cost and like like layer into that. But I don't know. I'm curious about people's like you said well, I would love to hear some people's responses, especially because we plan to do follow ups on some of the comments. It may be your episode. Maybe that's a good time to bring that up too. I think like everything we talk about, I think a big thing we talked about on the show is like I think all three of us like have like have pretty similar like ideals and values and like our good faith in the way we like bring stuff up and like argue about things. And if you guys have thoughts like I like when people engage in that same way. Like if you have new information or something relevant to what we talked about and you think it would be good for us to know or like you're opinion on something, I want to read that. I think a cool thing about this show is that as we dive into stuff, there will definitely be things we like miss or get wrong. And if you and if you bring stuff up in like the comments or I think we've talked about more structured ways to do that in the future, it'd be nice to like re-approach topics or things we talk about here. I don't want to pretend like I'm like as I try to like navigate the geopolitics of global trade pretend like I have it locked down. I spent two hours on Monday making a podcast episode about cream pies. I know where I stayed and I'm very all about cream pies. Okay, it's not all about cream pies, but it was like a good 15 minutes and it's just it's we didn't need it. Please meet on my next topic. So AI cream pies. Ford is going to be you know ford is wild. Ford is going to be unfortunately. Click the link below for our porn hub follow up episode. Yeah. They're paying the most right? So guys, this is really fun. This is I really like this for the episode. I had a good time. Want to do a or man shakes. Oh. Oh, great stuff. It's comfortable. We're going to be making an episode every week. We're going to be covering whatever is going on and whatever we feel like and post it on Thursday. Unless we're late, which none of us are ever late. We would have a lot of you like that. You just heard how seriously it takes that. I'm walking. And now this is the part of the show where a truck eats an entire raw lemon. No, that's not me. That's you. I've been baited. I forgot the lemon. There's one right there. We have real lemons on set. A truck will take a bite up until the skin ruptures. This is plastic. Oh, oh. Do you want to see me more alive? I'm going to sleep and comment in the fucking tour watching. That's true. Thanks for watching.\")]"

You used to need a painter for a few months to paint a thing and now it's going to be speak to your phone to get your video. So Hollywood will start using it to generate scenes, which completely opens up. Yeah, so you can make a movie like Avatar eventually for under a million dollars. Much less.

They are oracles currently is just text, but they will have calculators, they will have access to Google search, they will have all kinds of gadgets and gizmos, they will be able to operate the internet and find different information. And yeah, in some sense, that's kind of like currently what it looks like in terms of the development.

Unless there's some kind of way to track accurately like you're not allowed to create any program without showing tying yourself to that program. Like any program that runs on the internet you'll be able to trace every single human program that was involved with that program. Yeah maybe you have to start declaring when you know we have to start drawing those boundaries and keeping track of okay what are digital entities versus human entities and what is the ownership of human entities and digital entities and something like that.
